## Issue Resolved

**Problem**: Discord bot responses showed generic placeholders like "User 123", "User 456", "User 789" instead of actual usernames.

**Root Cause**: 
- RAG system was using `processed_content` field (with `[USER_MENTION]` placeholders) instead of `original_content` (with real Discord mentions)
- Discord mentions like `<@1359959114708418782>` were not being resolved to actual usernames
- Author name resolution was incomplete

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Content Field Priority Fix**: Changed to prioritize `original_content` over `processed_content`
2. **Author Name Resolution**: Added fallback to `author_name` field from metadata
3. **Discord Mention Resolution**: Created `MentionResolver` class that:
   - Loads user ID → username mapping from database
   - Converts `<@1359959114708418782>` → `@cristian_72225`
   - Caches 218 users for fast lookup
4. **Database Configuration Fix**: Fixed database path extraction from config

## Results After Fix

✅ **Real usernames displayed**: cristian_72225, oscarsan.chez, pabloallois_87684
✅ **No more generic placeholders**: User 123, User 456, User 789  
✅ **218 users cached** for fast mention resolution
✅ **Backward compatibility maintained** with fallbacks

## Current Active RAG Engine

The current active RAG engine (`core/rag_engine.py`) includes all the mention resolution improvements and should be used going forward.

## Notes

These archived files are kept for reference and rollback purposes if needed. They can be safely removed after confirming the new system works properly in production.
