      "content": "💡 crucial role in the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. He is widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists in history.\n\nNewton made major contributions to various fields, including:\n\n1. **Physics**: Newton developed the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which were presented in his groundbreaking book \"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) in 1687. His laws of motion describe how objects move and respond to forces, while his theory of gravity explains how all objects attract each other.\n2. **Calculus**: Newton, along with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, developed the mathematical field of calculus (differential and integral calculus). This work laid the foundation for modern mathematics and science.\n3. **Optics**: Newton was a pioneer in the study of light and color. He was the first to demonstrate that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors, which can be separated using a prism.\n\nSome of Newton's most notable achievements include:\n\n* Formulating the three laws of motion:\n\t1. The law of inertia (an object at rest will remain at rest, or an object in motion will continue moving).\n\t2. The law of acceleration (force applied to an object will change its motion).\n\t3. The law of reciprocal actions (every action has an equal and opposite reaction).\n* Developing the theory of universal gravitation, which states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points.\n* Conducting experiments on light and color, including his famous experiment with a prism, which demonstrated that white light is composed of different colors.\n\nNewton's work had a profound impact on the development of modern science, and his laws of motion and universal gravitation remain fundamental principles in physics and engineering to this day.",

      "content": "💡 pida. Aquí te presento el proceso:\n\n**Ingredientes:**\n\n* Huevos\n* Aceite o mantequilla para freír (preferiblemente aceite vegetal)\n* Sal\n* Pimienta (opcional)\n\n**Procedimiento:**\n\n1. **Batir los huevos**: Batir ligeramente los huevos en un tazón hasta que estén suaves y homogéneos.\n2. **Calentar el aceite o mantequilla**: Calentar una sartén a fuego medio-alto con suficiente aceite o mantequilla para cubrir la base de la sartén. La temperatura ideal es entre 160°C y 180°C (entre 325°F y 350°F).\n3. **Añadir los huevos**: Una vez que el aceite esté caliente, agregar los huevos batidos en la sartén. No es necesario esperar a que el aceite esté muy caliente para agregar los huevos.\n4. **Dejar cocinar**: Dejar cocinar los huevos durante unos 2-3 minutos o hasta que las claras estén firmes y las yemas estén cocidas, pero todavía jugosas.\n5. **Deshacer con una cuchara**: Usar una cuchara para deshacer lentamente los huevos fritos en pequeños pedazos, sin revolver demasiado. De esta manera, se mantendrá la textura y el sabor de los huevos.\n6. **Salar y pimenter (opcional)**: Salpimentar ligeramente los huevos con sal y pimienta a gusto.\n7. **Servir**: Servir los huevos fritos calientes, solos o con acompañamientos como tostadas, champiñones, espinacas, etc.\n\n**Consejos y variaciones:**\n\n* Utiliza huevos frescos para que sean más deliciosos.\n* Asegúrate de no revolver demasiado los huevos mientras se cocinan, ya que esto puede hacerlos desmoronarse.\n* Puedes agregar hierbas o especias como cebolla picada, ajo molido o orégano para darle un toque extra de sabor a tus huevos fritos.\n* Los huevos fritos también se pueden cocinar en una parrilla eléctrica o en un horno precalentado a 180°C (350°F). Simplemente coloca los huevos en una bandeja para horno y cocina durante unos 10-12 minutos, o hasta que estén cocidos a tu gusto.\n\nEspero que disfrutes de tus deliciosos huevos fritos!",

I also don't have a concept of \"most liked\" or likes as it's not possible for me to keep track of them.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for popular messages or posts from the last two days across different platforms such as social media, blogs, forums, or other online communities, I can suggest some ways to find out:\n\n1. Social media platforms: You can check trending topics and hashtags on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.\n2. Search engines: Use search engines like Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo to search for popular topics, news, and trending stories from the last two days.\n3. Online forums: Visit online forums related to specific interests or niches and see what's been discussed recently.\n4. News websites: Check out news websites, blogs, and publications to find recent articles that have gained popularity.\n\nPlease note that these methods are not definitive ways to determine the most liked messages in the last two days.

This is done using a simple averaging operation.\n2. **Prediction residuals**: The second part takes the original input data and subtracts the predicted columnwise means to obtain the prediction residuals.\n\nThe prediction residuals are then passed through the rest of the neural network, which learns to predict the residuals rather than the original inputs. This can help the model learn more robust and generalizable representations by focusing on the differences between individual samples rather than their absolute values.\n\n**Benefits of MCP**\n\nMCP has several benefits:\n\n1. **Improved generalization**: By learning to predict residuals rather than absolute values, MCP models tend to generalize better to new unseen data.\n2. **Reduced overfitting**: The mean columnwise prediction helps to regularize the model and reduce overfitting by capturing more global patterns in the data.\n3. **Enhanced feature learning**: The prediction residuals can help the model learn more robust features that are less affected by individual outliers or noisy samples.\n\n**Applications of MCP**\n\nMCP has been successfully applied in various AI applications, including:\n\n1. **Computer vision**: MCP has been used to improve image classification and object detection models.\n2. **Natural language processing (NLP)**: MCP has been employed to enhance text classification and sentiment analysis models.\n3. **Time series forecasting**: MCP has been used to predict time series data with better accuracy.\n\nIn summary, MCP is a technique that helps neural networks learn more robust and generalizable representations by predicting the mean of each column in the input data and then learning to predict the residuals.

In other words, GenAI would be capable of:\n\n1. **Learning**: Absorbing new information and concepts from various sources.\n2. **Reasoning**: Drawing logical conclusions based on the learned knowledge.\n3. **Applying**: Using the acquired knowledge to solve problems in diverse domains.\n\nGenAI is often contrasted with Narrow or Weak AI, which are designed for specific tasks, such as:\n\n* Image recognition\n* Natural language processing (NLP)\n* Speech recognition\n* Expert systems\n\nWhile these Narrow AIs excel in their respective areas, they lack the general intelligence and ability to generalize that a GenAI system would possess.\n\nThe concept of GenAI has sparked significant interest and debate among AI researchers, ethicists, and scientists. Some argue that achieving General Intelligence is essential for advancing AI research, while others caution about the potential risks and challenges associated with creating such an intelligent machine.\n\nSome notable milestones in the pursuit of GenAI include:\n\n1. **AlphaGo**: A computer program developed by Google DeepMind that defeated a human world champion in Go, a complex board game.\n2. **DeepMind's AlphaFold**: A system that can predict protein structures from their sequences with unprecedented accuracy, demonstrating GenAI-like capabilities.\n\nWhile we have not yet achieved true General Intelligence, these advancements demonstrate the significant progress being made in AI research and the potential for future breakthroughs.",

      "content": "💡 n for the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century.\n\nHere are some of Newton's key achievements:\n\n1. **Laws of Motion**: Newton formulated three laws that bear his name: the Law of Inertia (first law), the Law of Acceleration (second law), and the Law of Action-Reaction (third law). These laws describe how objects move and respond to forces, and they are still widely used today in fields like engineering, physics, and astronomy.\n2. **Universal Gravitation**: Newton's most famous achievement is his theory of universal gravitation, which states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force proportional to their masses and the distance between them. This theory explained many phenomena, such as the falling of objects on Earth and the motion of planets around the Sun.\n3. **Calculus**: Newton, along with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, developed calculus (also known as infinitesimal mathematics). Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change, slopes, and accumulation. It has become an essential tool for scientists and engineers to analyze complex phenomena.\n4. **Optics**: Newton was also a skilled experimentalist and made important contributions to the study of optics. He studied the behavior of light and color, and his work on the nature of light led to the development of modern telescopes and microscopes.\n5. **Algebra**: Newton was a master of algebraic manipulation and developed many mathematical techniques that are still used today. His work on algebraic equations helped lay the foundations for modern mathematics.\n\nNewton's work had a profound impact on the scientific community, and his theories and laws have stood the test of time. He is considered one of the most important figures in the Scientific Revolution, alongside other giants like Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler.\n\nSo, that's who Newton is!",

He made major contributions to many fields, including:\n\n1. **Physics**: Newton laid the foundation for classical mechanics with his laws of motion (the three laws of motion) and universal gravitation. His work on calculus, optics, and fluid dynamics also had significant impacts.\n2. **Mathematics**: Newton developed calculus, which is a fundamental tool in mathematics and science today. He introduced the concept of fluxions (now known as derivatives) and developed the method of infinite series.\n3. **Astronomy**: Newton's work on the motion of celestial bodies led to a deeper understanding of the solar system and the behavior of comets.\n\nSome of his most notable achievements include:\n\n* Developing the theory of universal gravitation, which explains how all objects in the universe attract each other with a force proportional to their mass and distance.\n* Formulating the three laws of motion: the law of inertia, the law of acceleration, and the law of reciprocal actions.\n* Developing calculus, including the method of fluxions (derivatives) and the method of infinite series (integration).\n* Proposing the concept of absolute time and space.\n\nNewton's work had a profound impact on the development of modern science, and his laws remain fundamental principles in fields like physics, engineering, and astronomy to this day.",

His 1950 paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" proposed the Turing Test, a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to that of a human.\n2. Marvin Minsky (1927-2016) and Seymour Papert (1929-present): These two American computer scientists wrote the influential book \"Perceptrons\" in 1969, which introduced the concept of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and laid the foundation for modern neural networks.\n3. John McCarthy (1927-2011): An American computer scientist and cognitive scientist, McCarthy coined the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" in 1956 and organized the first AI conference at Dartmouth College in 1956.\n4. Frank Rosenblatt (1928-1971): An American psychologist and computer scientist, Rosenblatt developed the perceptron, a type of feedforward neural network, and made significant contributions to the development of AI and machine learning.\n5. Donald Michie (1923-2007) and Patrick Hartley: These two British computer scientists worked on early AI projects in the 1950s and 1960s, including the development of the first AI program, called Logic Theorist.\n6. Joseph Weizenbaum (1923-2008): A German-American computer scientist, Weizenbaum developed the ELIZA chatbot in 1966, which could simulate human-like conversations.\n7. Edward Feigenbaum and Craig A. Fields: These two American computer scientists developed the MYCIN expert system in 1976, which was one of the first AI systems to be used in medical diagnosis.\n\nThese individuals, along with many others, have contributed to the development of AI through their research, innovations, and applications. The field continues to evolve, with ongoing advancements in areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.",

He is credited with driving many of the company's key innovations, including the development of the first commercial RDBMS and the creation of the Oracle Database 7 platform.\n\nPhilanthropy:\n\nEllison has been recognized for his philanthropic efforts, particularly in the areas of education and medical research. In 2010, he donated $2 billion to establish the Lawrence Ellison Foundation, which focuses on supporting education, healthcare, and environmental initiatives.\n\nIn 2008, Ellison founded the Ask.com Foundation, which aimed to improve access to quality educational resources and opportunities for underprivileged students.\n\nPersonal Life:\n\nEllison has been married three times: to Lois Ann Ellison (married in 1969, divorced in 1978), Nancy Walton Jenkins (married in 1983, divorced in 2004), and Melanie Craft (married in 2010).\n\nHe is known for his love of sailing and owns several luxury yachts. In 2012, he purchased the Hawaiian island of Lanai, making him one of the few people to own a complete island.\n\nControversies:\n\nEllison has faced controversy over his business practices, particularly regarding Oracle's acquisition strategies and treatment of employees. He has also been criticized for his views on climate change and his support for coal mining.\n\nLegacy:\n\nLarry Ellison is widely regarded as one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the history of technology. His innovative approach to software development and his ability to drive growth through strategic acquisitions have made Oracle a dominant force in the industry. Despite facing criticism and controversy, Ellison remains an influential figure in the tech world and continues to shape the future of enterprise software.",

His three laws of motion, which were presented in his book \"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) in 1687, describe how objects move and respond to forces.\n\nNewton's law of universal gravitation states that every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force acting along the line intersecting both points. This law explains many phenomena, such as:\n\n1. The falling of objects on Earth.\n2. The motion of planets around the Sun.\n3. The tides caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon.\n\nNewton's work had a profound impact on the development of modern science and technology. His laws of motion and universal gravitation laid the foundation for classical mechanics, which was further developed by other scientists such as Leonhard Euler, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, and Pierre-Simon Laplace.\n\nSome of Newton's notable achievements include:\n\n1. Developing calculus, a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation.\n2. Formulating the laws of motion and universal gravitation.\n3. Making significant contributions to the study of optics, including the development of the first practical telescope.\n4. Being elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1672, which is now one of the oldest and most prestigious scientific organizations in the world.\n\nNewton's legacy extends beyond science and technology. He was a devout Christian who believed that his work on natural philosophy was guided by God. His laws of motion and universal gravitation were seen as evidence of the underlying order and harmony in the universe, reflecting God's design.\n\nIn summary, Sir Isaac Newton was a groundbreaking scientist whose work on mathematics, optics, physics, and astronomy had a profound impact on our understanding of the natural world.",
