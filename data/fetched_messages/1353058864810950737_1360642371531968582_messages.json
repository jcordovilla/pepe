      "content": "I'm not a regular user of Canva, so my first thought in reading this article was \"why would they try to re-create spreadsheets and word docs and powerpoints, those are already done just fine elsewhere\" but in reflecting on it, it makes more sense. Seems like they're trying to increase share of wallet with their customers so they'll stay in the Canva platform rather than copying and pasting from other places. Seems like most AI companies are focusing on creating an integrated vertical experience as their main go-to-market strategy. This makes sense with venture capitalist views I've heard that AI native companies will replace entire workflows and price on outputs, aligning price much more closely with the value it creates.",
