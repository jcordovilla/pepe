The new framework sheds light on how scientists could fuse strategies from different methods to improve existing AI models or come up with new ones. link to article is https://news.mit.edu/2025/machine-learning-periodic-table-could-fuel-ai-discovery-0423\n🙋‍♀️Question here is can you walk us through this AI periodic table and demonstrate how one might use it ?\n\n8️⃣ OpenAI x Jony Ive reaction 💼\nQ. Do you have initial thoughts on the OpenAI acquisition of Jony Ive’s Startup IO for $6.5Bn this week?\n\n9️⃣ AI agents: reliability & flexibility 🧩\nWhat’s the current state of AI agents in terms of reliability and safety? I’m curious to understand whether agents are already trustworthy enough to be deployed for specific tasks (like assistance, automation, or analysis), or if there are still major limitations to keep in mind.\nAlso, to what extent can an agent handle different types of functions or adapt to new contexts without losing accuracy? How flexible are they really when it comes to performing a variety of tasks?\n\n🔟 Multi-agent governance & safety ⚖️\nWhat will be the key challenges and, therefore, necessary aspects of governance and guardrails to ensure trust, compliance, and safety (e.g. regarding authentication and authorization for payments) – especially when multiple agents interact?",

Is that the right way forward?",

If standards would be beneficial, what criteria/minimum quality benchmarks (transparency, fairness, registration, security, …) make sense, and which institutions could act as standard setters?\n\n2️⃣ The EU AI Act is often criticized for weak enforcement. From a technical or architectural perspective, what innovations or system-level designs could make such regulations more enforceable in practice?\n\n3️⃣ As generative AI models become more capable and autonomous, what governance frameworks or safeguards are essential to ensure responsible innovation without stifling creativity?\n\n4️⃣ As domain-specific AI applications and niche-use-case start-ups rapidly multiply, how do you think this trend will influence or impact the future of GenAI for enterprises and for individuals?\n\n5️⃣ Definition of teams in relation to AI — If AI continues to evolve as both tool and collaborator, how might this challenge our fundamental understanding of what constitutes a “team” in creative and technical contexts?\n\n6️⃣ With the rise of agentic AI and more specialized models, how do you see the roles of large and small models evolving in enterprise AI architectures? Follow-up Q: What are the identified and potential risks and biases regarding unsupervised decisions made by AAI?\n\n7️⃣ What are the standard best practices for designing AI systems with optimal memory utilization while minimizing computational and power overhead—especially in light of the growing concern around energy constraints and sustainability in large-scale AI deployments? I have been part of AI automation for a year and haven’t found the best capacity manager—many times, adjustments are made ad-hoc based on requirements.",
