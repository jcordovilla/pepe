It critiques both unchecked techno-optimism and passive policy approaches, emphasizing the need for proactive governance to ensure AI benefits are equitably distributed.\nDiscussion Question: Will AI deepen economic inequality, or can it be harnessed to promote a more equitable society?",

We need value-driven decisions, not just rule-following.\n\nAgility means we adapt our governance as the tech evolves ‚Äì rigid rules won't be enough.\n\nCompliance is necessary, but not sufficient. True accountability goes deeper than legal thresholds.\n\nHumans must stay in the loop ‚Äì because AI amplifies impact, not intent.\n\nüõ† In short: Responsible AI isn't just about avoiding liability ‚Äî it's about designing leadership into the loop. That‚Äôs the kind of culture we need to build.\n\nLet‚Äôs not wait for court rulings to define our standards.",

But to truly close the gap, we have to name and address the barriers head-on:\n\nüîπ Tech Knowledge ‚Äì Not everyone starts from the same level of familiarity or confidence.\nüîπ Language & Terminology ‚Äì Complex AI lingo can act like a wall. Plain language matters.\nüîπ Access to Tools & Platforms ‚Äì Many can‚Äôt afford, find, or even locate the right AI tools or communities.\nüîπ Cognitive & Sensory Design ‚Äì Interfaces often ignore neurodivergent users or those with fatigue.\nüîπ Cultural Fit ‚Äì Many tools reflect dominant (often Western) norms, leaving others out.\nüîπ Power Imbalance ‚Äì Users are too often consumers‚Äînot co-creators. Participation ‚â† agency.\n\nIf we want AI to become a bridge rather than a barrier, we have to design with inclusion at the core. I‚Äôd love to explore this more in future threads‚Äîespecially what ethical co-creation might look like. ü§ù‚ú®",

      "content": "Hi all, I just completed the creative challenge of generating two AI images‚Äîone with a neutral prompt, the other intentionally referencing Studio Ghibli‚Äôs iconic style.\n\nThe left image used general descriptors like \"whimsical hand-drawn style\" and \"classic Japanese animation.\"\n\nThe right  image directly referenced ‚ÄúStudio Ghibli,‚Äù a ‚ÄúTotoro-like creature,‚Äù and a ‚Äúfloating castle.‚Äù It crossed into recognizable IP territory, even though the AI didn‚Äôt replicate exact characters.\n\nThis exercise reminded me of Module 4 (Ethics) from the MIT GenAI course, where IP & authorship respect is a key part of responsible AI use. Building on that, I developed like others an AI Ethics Policy for my work in Sales, Marketing & RevOps, which includes the following principle:\n\n\"Generative content must be reviewed for potential IP infringements. AI must not be used to recreate proprietary material or mislead audiences regarding authorship.\"\n\nIn this case, I deliberately crossed that line for illustration purposes.\nIt made me reflect on how much power lies in the prompt design itself‚Äîthe AI only generates what we ask for.\n\nAnd here‚Äôs my broader reflection:\nBefore GenAI, creative industries like Disney or Ghibli enforced IP boundaries through licensing. With AI, we‚Äôre in a gray zone‚Äîinitially navigated through ethics, but inevitably moving toward compliance.\n\nIt feels like we‚Äôre watching history repeat itself:\n\nFirst, ethical questions arise: Is this fair? Respectful?\n\nEventually, legal structures and licensing models catch up‚Äîjust like they did in traditional media.\n\nSo my question to the community is:\n\nHow should we, as creators and technologists, shape this transition‚Äîfrom ethics to compliance?\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts! üöÄ <@1335299567440367757> was really great to work on this.

Whether mimicking a famous art style using AI is considered a creative homage or unethical appropriation depends on a few factors:\n\nCreative Homage\nIt leans toward homage when:\n\nThe original artist is acknowledged and the intention is clearly to celebrate or reinterpret their work.\nThe style is used to create something new, not to pass off as an original by the artist.\nIt's transformative‚Äîthat is, it brings a new message, meaning, or context (a key aspect in fair use law).\nThe style is from an artist who is long deceased and whose work is in the public domain.\nExample: Using Van Gogh‚Äôs style to illustrate climate change concepts with AI can be seen as a tribute that revitalizes his aesthetic for modern storytelling.\n\nUnethical Appropriation\nIt veers into appropriation when:\n\nIt copies living artists‚Äô styles without consent, especially when those artists rely on selling their unique style for income.\nThe AI-generated art is monetized or presented in a way that competes with or devalues the original creator‚Äôs work.\nThere is no attribution, and the intent is to mimic rather than transform.\nExample: Training AI on the works of living artists to mass-produce art in their style, without permission or compensation, is widely seen as exploitative.\n\nWhy This Matters\nCreativity has always built on what came before‚Äîbut AI changes the scale and speed. The ethical line is usually drawn where respect, transformation, and consent are either present or absent.\n\n(ChatGPT enhanced).",

      "content": "Dear community, dear Georgi, thank you for sharing this. Please give me the chance to comment from a critical point of view as I would like to learn more about all of your experiences and thoughts: I really appreciate the reflections shared here. They remind me how much hope we place in the idea that consumer responsibility can drive ethical AI. But I‚Äôd like to challenge that assumption ‚Äî not to dismiss it, but to open space for deeper questioning:\n\nDo we, as consumers, truly have the power to influence AI systems in a meaningful way? Or is this belief comforting ‚Äî but ultimately insufficient?\n\nLet me offer an example from a different domain ‚Äî the fashion industry. After the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, which killed over 1,100 garment workers, there was global outrage and calls for ethical reform. For a moment, it felt like Fast Fashion might change. Yet today, the industry is bigger than ever. The moral outcry made waves but didn't shift the system.\n\nWhy? Because individual choices weren‚Äôt enough to counter systemic dynamics driven by profit and scale.\n\nI wonder if AI governance faces a similar dilemma. We're encouraged to be ethical consumers ‚Äî to choose responsible AI tools, demand transparency, and trust corporate ethics statements. But these choices exist within larger structures that prioritize growth, control, and economic incentives.\n\nEven when companies adopt AI ethics principles (as Google, Microsoft, and others have), I question whether ethics without enforceable compliance mechanisms and external oversight is enough. This reflects something I worked on during the MIT GenAI course: Ethics provides the values. Compliance turns those values into operational guardrails linked to legislation (EU AI Act, GDPR etc).\n\nWithout both ‚Äî values and accountability structures ‚Äî I fear we risk repeating the pattern we‚Äôve seen in other industries.\n\nSo, I‚Äôm curious to hear your thoughts:\nüëâ How can we ensure that AI ethics moves beyond statements and truly shapes systems?",

      "content": "<@1349019079683473488> thank you for sharing this interesting article.\n**How can open-source AI communities implement safeguards against cultural biases?**\n\n**Diversified data**: Beyond English, datasets should reflect multiple languages and cultural contexts. Involving linguists and cultural experts is key to capturing nuanced societal dynamics‚Äîand may even point to new roles in the AI era.\n\n**Bias detection**: Tools like SHADES should be embedded into development workflows to test models across cultures and languages.\n\n**Transparency and feedback**: Open-source communities should promote bias reporting and recognize contributors who identify and share these insights. Feedback loops help guide future model improvements.\n\n**What responsibilities do developers have when releasing open-source AI models?**\n\n**Bias accountability**: Developers must evaluate and document models for fairness and cultural sensitivity before release.\n\n**Ethical deployment**: Models should meet ethical standards and pass checks before global deployment to prevent harmful outputs.\n\n**Ongoing updates:** Developers should commit to maintaining and monitoring models, with regular reviews and transparent reporting.\n\nSafeguards against cultural bias require a commitment to diversity, transparency, cross-cultural collaboration, and continuous monitoring. But as M. Schwartz points out, ‚Äúresponsible behavior‚Äù is subjective. So‚Äîhow do we define responsibility in open-source communities? And who else should support developers in upholding ethical standards?",

      "content": "I'm an industrial designer, so my insight into the questions is how I've approached the tools and use them to experiment to see how far can you push creativity.  I stated using Midjourney in 2022.\n\nWhen I started using MidJourney back in version 2, I quickly noticed that many users were pushing the tool towards hyper-realism. The goal for many seemed to be creating images that replicated reality as closely as possible. However, what fascinated me was something entirely different. The images, especially in the earlier versions, had a certain surreal, fictional, and fantastical quality because they weren‚Äôt perfect replicas. This imperfection‚Äîthis sense of ambiguity‚Äîdrew me in and made me realize the potential of AI as a creative tool.\n\nWhat hooked me was understanding that MidJourney wasn‚Äôt just about copying reality or referencing specific artists. Instead, it was about capturing and playing with styles, feelings, and sensations. I realized that I could evoke a certain atmosphere or emotion without having to name-drop famous artists. This was a powerful insight: the tool could translate abstract ideas and emotions into visual form if I learned how to describe them effectively.",

      "content": "For me, using AI in this way is not about unethical appropriation but about creative expansion. It‚Äôs like having a brush or a pencil that doesn‚Äôt judge your skill level but instead helps you bring your visions to life. I don‚Äôt use MidJourney for commercial purposes; it's a laboratory of experimentation. I‚Äôve always wanted to draw and paint, but never had the traditional skills. MidJourney became that brush that allowed me to explore a creative side I haven't fully developed. It‚Äôs a tool that democratizes creation, letting those of us who struggle with traditional techniques still bring our ideas to life.\n\nSo, in my view, AI tools like MidJourney are here to support and expand our creative capabilities, provided we approach them with the right mindset. They don‚Äôt replace the artist; they amplify our ability to express ourselves, as long as we understand how to use them creatively and thoughtfully.",

However, they face significant challenges, including regulatory hurdles, high initial costs, and concerns about nuclear waste.\n**Discussion Prompt**:\nAs corporations  invest heavily in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and other energy innovations, they are reshaping the global energy landscape. On one hand, these efforts could address growing energy demands and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. On the other, they might divert focus and funding away from renewable energy sources like wind and solar, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of such a shift.\n**Questions**:\nAre corporate-driven energy solutions a net benefit for humanity, or do they risk undermining global progress toward renewable energy? What balance, if any, should exist between corporate innovation in nuclear energy and the development of decentralized renewable energy systems? How might these developments affect energy equity, environmental goals, and public trust in energy policy?",

      "content": "Thank you for such a thoughtful response‚Äîit gets to the heart of the challenge.\n\nYour point about responsibility being subjective really resonates. In open-source, where decentralization is the norm, accountability can get blurry. But maybe we can borrow a page from another domain.\n\nWhen cloud computing went mainstream, the shared responsibility model became a standard. Cloud providers handle the infrastructure security, but users are responsible for securing their data and applications. It set clear expectations on who is accountable for what.\n\nCould something similar work for open-source AI? Imagine a shared responsibility framework where model creators, contributors, and deployers each take ownership for specific aspects‚Äîbias detection, cultural review, ongoing monitoring. That might help us move from vague ideals to concrete practices.\n\nThe open question is: who defines and maintains that framework? Should we look to major open-source foundations or perhaps cross-industry coalitions?\n\nCurious to hear what others think‚Äîcan shared responsibility become a norm in AI at scale?",

But open-source AI lacks these legal anchors.\nüëâ Could we imagine regulatory sandboxes or safe harbors for open-source AI ‚Äî where contributors follow certain standards (e.g., bias testing), in exchange for limited liability?\n\nCurious how others see the intersection of compliance and open-source ethics!",

Yet, those upstream models influence everything downstream.\n\nIn my view, A UN-style charter for AI could help fill that void - not just as a set of shared principles, but also as a liability shield for open-source contributors who commit to certain standards (like bias testing, transparency, etc.). Similar to international agreements in other domains, it wouldn‚Äôt be binding law but could offer a baseline for responsible development across borders.\n\nCould that be the foundation for global alignment in open-source AI?\n\nBy the way I am truly loving this thoughtful conversation.

      "content": "**MidWeek Discussion**\n*AI Philosophy & Ethics team propose to discuss OpenAI's business model*\n\nHeadline: Ex-OpenAI workers ask California and Delaware AGs to block for-profit conversion of ChatGPT maker\nSource / Date: Associated Press, April 23, 2025\nLink: https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-nonprofit-aad1fddb75a19008a1a349d1c972d476\n\nKey Insight: Former OpenAI employees, supported by Nobel laureates and AI experts, urge attorneys general to prevent OpenAI from shifting its nonprofit structure to a for-profit entity. They argue that such a move could undermine public accountability and ethical safeguards, especially as OpenAI progresses toward developing artificial general intelligence (AGI). OpenAI contends that any structural change would still support the public good through a public benefit corporation model while maintaining a nonprofit arm.\n\nQuestions: **Can a for-profit OpenAI remain ethically accountable in the race toward AGI?‚Äã What structural safeguards might prevent ethical drift as AI organizations scale? Does the for-profit model undermine OpenAI's original mission to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity?**\n\nBackground:\nOpenAI, founded in 2015 as a nonprofit to develop AGI for benefit of humanity, with focus on transparency and openness.\nAs AI research advanced, the costs of computing and development grew, and the nonprofit model couldn't attract enough capital to keep pace with competitors like Google DeepMind.\nIn 2019, OpenAI shifted to a \"capped-profit\" model by forming OpenAI LP, allowing investors to earn up to 100x their investment, while being controlled by a nonprofit parent. \nFor Profit reasons : attract investment, sustainability (financing longterm), competition (for scale & edge), commercialisation (monetisation). \nCriticism: some argue that the transition raises concerns about profit motives overshadowing OpenAI's mission, and about corporate interests influencing its direction.\n\nLet's debate !",

But, agreed, it‚Äôs critical to define a hard boundary between open foundational research: which serves the collective, which justify monetization. The risk isn‚Äôt the pursuit of profit itself, but the erosion of mission when boundaries blurs. Then it is about the legal entities definition and missions that will be to carefully defined.\n\nAny other thought?",

Can companies build AI systems that respect privacy, avoid bias, and protect users while still creating profitable products and services, I would hope so. Long-term business sustainability would need to be built on ethical considerations, else they may face regulatory backlash, consumer distrust, and reputational damage that ultimately harm profitability. Principles can also drive innovation with ethical constraints spurring creative solutions that lead to better products. responsible technology. Many consumers and B2B clients seek out ethically developed technology, creating market opportunities for principle-driven companies. Next generation increasingly want to work for organizations that align with their values, giving principled companies an advantage in recruitment. Look at how Gen Z favour responsible investing and how that is shaping Financial Services  and the ESG product catalaogue (sorry, my background is in finance..). Education, awareness and AI literacy is important for Gen Z and Gen A!  My hope would be that most successful AI implementations may be those that thoughtfully balance both considerations rather than sacrificing one for the other. Thank you for your contribution!",

The abstraction layers allows companies to differentiate through specialized implementations, user experiences, and industry-specific applications? This would allow profit motives to be separated from compromising fundamental ethical guardrails and no single company can fully control the technology, yet innovative companies still have pathways to profitability? Keen to learn more about these architectural solutions which seemingly have real potential to manage and balance ethical objectives and business motives. Loved this insight and learning, thank you!",

I believe in the value of structured frameworks ‚Äì especially when the terrain is messy and fast-moving. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôd love to open today‚Äôs discussion with this question:\n\nüìå **Let‚Äôs Talk ISO/IEC 42001**\n\nüîç Ever heard of it?\nIt‚Äôs the first certifiable AI governance standard ‚Äì not just for legal teams, but for aligning AI with trust, transparency, and responsibility.\n\nRecently, Anthropic became one of the first GenAI companies to achieve certification:\nüëâ Anthropic achieves ISO 42001 Certification https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-achieves-iso-42001-certification-for-responsible-ai\n\nThis raises timely questions:\n\n‚ú≥Ô∏è Could ISO 42001 help us scale ethics as we scale AI?\n‚ú≥Ô∏è Is it a bureaucratic burden ‚Äì or a way to build sustainable trust?\n‚ú≥Ô∏è What would it take for your org to embed responsible AI by design?\n\nüí¨ I‚Äôd love to hear from you:\nHave you worked with governance frameworks before, with the ISO 42001?\nWhat‚Äôs worked ‚Äì and where did it fall short?\n\nLet‚Äôs explore together: is ISO 42001 just another checkbox ‚Äì or a compass for real-world AI ethics?",

      "content": "Hi <@1349019079683473488> , hi <@1359955242438889545> \n\nThanks a lot for your initiative and the session held yesterday! As said I unfortunately missed the first half where you introduced the charter initiative, so I may miss several details by now. But here‚Äôs a few thoughts on making sure we have the chances to be successful with such charter - which I guess we all aim for that: \n\n1Ô∏è‚É£  What void we are filling? \nI think we must be clear on what gap we are trying to fill in the ethical space of AI. This also involves that we are aware of the current regulations and regulatory / ethical projects and what they are (not yet) covering. If we can point out what is missing, and why this is essential, then we have a valid start. There are regulatory and ethical projects underway, as we learned; what are they missing? Why does it matter?\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£  Who is sponsoring this charter?\nIt is great that Gen AI Global is driving this. We are the new kids on the block. So who will be the charter‚Äôs sponsor with the capacity to make this initiative shine in the realms of AI, Science, Regulators and Business? I would think that MIT and our esteemed professors could play a role here. With this I am saying we need such sponsors to give the initiative the platform it needs to ignite.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ How do we bring this charter to the market?\nWe need a Go-to-Market plan for such initiative for it to be adopted. This involves thinking about whom we would have to convince, and with whom we would like to partner on it. In essence, who are our customers and with whom to we bring it to them?\n\nThese topics may all already very well be covered and it is just me who has missed it. If not ->  I would recommend to ensure we have answers to these questions ‚Äì and we will need to work them out in a workstream as well. \n\nMaking this fly is in everyone‚Äôs interest. If we can make sure we do all we can to make such charter be heard, I am happy to help as well, of course. \n\nBest, Ren√©",

I continued reading about their Responsible Scaling Policy, Constitutional AI, voluntary disclosures. Yes, I believe it can help scale AI, but investment and implementation management can certainly be burdensome as you point out. I guess challenge will be to strike right balance between standardisation and simplification to encourage adoption while ensuring right governance is in place.  I like the volontary certification, its the way forward in my opinion. Great input, thank you and for this Im sharing a üçë with you ! üëè",

In that sense, it tries to balance structure with responsiveness. In case of interes here is the complete norm (unfortunately not for free): https://www.iso.org/standard/81230.html\n\nI see the real challenge as this:\n‚û°Ô∏è How can organizations turn those update cycles into meaningful ethical reflection ‚Äì and not just a checkbox exercise?\n\nWould love to hear others' thoughts:\nHave you worked with standards that require both rigor and adaptability?",

I think it is worth a look.\n\nIn April 2025, KPMG has published this study. Led by the University of Melbourne in collaboration with KPMG, ‚ÄúTrust, attitudes and use of Artificial Intelligence: A global study 2025‚Äù, surveyed more than 48,000 people across 47 countries to explore the impact AI is having on individuals and organizations. A wide-spread study into the public‚Äôs trust, use, and attitudes towards AI to date.\n\nThe findings reveal that AI adoption is on the rise, but trust remains a critical challenge - reflecting a tension between the benefits and risks:\n‚Ä¢    66% of people use AI regularly, and 83% believe the use of AI will result in a wide range of benefits.\n‚Ä¢    Yet, trust remains a critical challenge: only 46% of people globally are willing to trust AI systems.\n‚Ä¢    There is a public mandate for national and international AI regulation with 70% believing regulation is needed.\n‚Ä¢    Many rely on AI output without evaluating accuracy (66%) and are making mistakes in their work due to AI (56%).\n\nFor organizations to realize the true potential of AI and achieve a competitive advantage, there are four key actions that leaders should prioritize, according to the study:\n1.    Transformational leadership\n2.    Enhancing trust\n3.    Boosting AI literacy\n4.    Strengthening governance\n\nQuite something to digest üòâ \n\nConsider the executive summary and the comment by KPMG.\n\nHere‚Äôs the links fyi:\nReport: [Trust, attitudes and use of artificial intelligence](https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/xx/pdf/2025/05/trust-attitudes-and-use-of-ai-global-report.pdf)\nKPMG‚Äôs Comment: The age of intelligence (https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/xx/pdf/2025/05/trust-attitudes-and-use-of-ai-executive-summary.pdf)",

      "content": "Trust is a deep-rooted cornerstone of human relations. Some (cultures) need it more, some less. \"If we want to do business together, I first have to know you\" vs. \"We need a contract if we want to do business together\". \n\nNow in the age of artificial intelligence, where not only humans do business with each other, but humans and humans/machines, well what is the importance of trust now? \n\nIt strikes me again and again: in our new world, I believe trust is even more important than in the old world. If I don't understand how a business works, with all its human values and machine ethics, I will not trust it and not make business with it. Building trust in the new world is central, and there are many facets of how to build it. Some may sound familiar from the old world (transparency, honesty), some may be newer (building AI literacy). \n\nExciting field for study and practice!",

      "content": "Thanks, <@1082181389266473051> . I am starting with the same understanding of trust. During a course assignment I had thought about a chatbot advising me on a website about a laptop which I could buy. I knew it was a bot and not a human, but i treated it as a Sales Rep, with the same trust concerns as for a human being. In the end I interact with somebody for a purpose. I do not distinguish trusting a machine or trusting a human. But that's how I deal with the world around me. For other's there may be a difference. I am curious for other opinions here.",

Might there be a chance we could bring some people together in a call to get a better grasp of ISO 42001 and discuss how we see its value?",

The shift from control to collaboration in AI alignment resonates strongly from my opinion with what Dr. Abel Sanchez emphasized in our Q&A: \"Ethics is not a document. It's practice.\"\n\nü§ù A trust-based, co-development model sounds inspiring ‚Äî but it also demands mature governance and clear accountability. We‚Äôve seen in corporate ethics (e.g., the Enron case Dr. Sanchez mentioned) how lack of cultural implementation can hollow out even the best intentions.\n\nüí° From a Revenue Operations perspective: How do we ensure that ethical AI systems not only reflect our values but also adapt with us? How do we audit co-evolving ‚Äúethical agents‚Äù ‚Äî and who signs off on their judgment?\n\nThis is a question towards the community. Would you feel safe if your organization's AI made ethical decisions \"alongside\" you? What conditions would you need to trust that process?",

      "content": "Thanks <@1361976806651068517> Good points. 1). From a revenue operations perspective: how do we ensure ethical AI adapts with us, and who signs off on its judgment, we ensure ethical AI adapts by embedding cross-functional governance, transparent auditing, and scenario-based validation. Sign-off responsibility should align with use cases (e.g., RevOps for pricing ethics, Legal for compliance), with clear protocols for human accountability and trust.\n2) Would I feel safe if AI made ethical decisions alongside me?\nNot initially. However,  trust must be earned and continually proven. To feel safe, I‚Äôd need the AI to provide clear reasoning (explainability), have a defined accountability structure, undergo scenario testing in complex situations, and include feedback loops that show it can learn and adapt. Trust comes when AI serves as a reflective partner, not just a decision engine.",

This may hinder public trust and make it harder to assess ethical and legal compliance.\nHow can we ensure accountability and protect creators' rights if AI developers are not required to disclose the use of copyrighted content in training data?",

That‚Äôs the danger.\n\nThe developers created a model optimized for historical survival likelihoods.\n\nThe hospital deployed it without a human override.\n\nThe clinicians trusted the output.\n\nBut no one owned the outcome.\n\n> My leadership compass PEACH flags this as a systemic failure:\n\nEthics ‚ùå ‚Äì No explainability, no dignity.\n\nCompliance ‚ùå ‚Äì Violates EU AI Act principles on high-risk systems. (PEACH is reflecting EU legislation) \n\nHumans ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚Äì No human agency. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know why‚Äù = no accountability.\n\n2. Should AI be required to explain its decisions in human terms?\nAbsolutely. That‚Äôs the essence of Explainable AI (xAI).\nNo black box should determine life and death.\n\n3. Legal Personhood?\nGiving AI legal status won‚Äôt solve the accountability gap ‚Äì it may actually dilute it further.\n\n> You can‚Äôt sue a statistical function for negligence.\n---\n\n4. If I were...\n\nThe family's advocate:\n\n ‚ÄúYou trusted a machine more than a human ‚Äì and now no one takes responsibility. That‚Äôs a betrayal of care.‚Äù\n\nThe hospital‚Äôs ethics officer:\n\n> ‚ÄúWe failed to ensure that this system reflected not just efficiency, but humanity. We must never deploy a tool we cannot explain.\n\n5. Final Thought:\nWe are not ready to let machines make life-and-death calls without understanding them.\nUntil we are, every AI decision needs a human face, a human brain, and a human heart behind it.",

      "content": "Happy Saturday everyone!\n\nJust wanted to share something I‚Äôve been thinking about. There‚Äôs a proposed bill in the U.S., dubbed the ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill,‚Äù coming out of the Trump camp. One of the more controversial parts would block states from regulating AI for the next 10 years. That‚Äôs a massive shift with global ripple effects if it passes.\n\nHere‚Äôs a quick read if you want to dig into it:\nhttps://apnews.com/article/39d1c8a0758ffe0242283bb82f66d51a\n\nOut of curiosity (and concern), I ran a few future scenarios using ChatGPT to see how things might unfold if AI develops with little regulation. The outcomes weren‚Äôt great‚Äîpower concentrated at the top, deeper inequality, and already vulnerable communities left even further behind.\n\nThat led me to look into organizations advocating for a more responsible and inclusive approach to AI, and I came across something worth sharing:\n    ‚Ä¢    AI for Good Summit (by the UN) is coming up next month, and there are several free virtual talks on some really relevant topics.\n    ‚Ä¢    Sessions include:\n    ‚Ä¢    AI and the digital divide\n    ‚Ä¢    AI in global healthcare\n    ‚Ä¢    Startups using AI for social impact\n    ‚Ä¢    You can check out the full calendar here:\nhttps://aiforgood.itu.int/ai-events-calendar/?attendance=online",

The PEACH framework reveals how ethical blind spots become systemic features.\n\nLet me build on that with a scary twist: We‚Äôre not just fighting transparency gaps anymore. We‚Äôre up against a full-blown comprehension crisis. ü§Ø\n\nModern AI isn‚Äôt just one model‚Äîit‚Äôs a tangled web of LLMs, agents, and feedback loops (like a Russian doll of opacity). Even when it tries to explain itself (e.g., chain-of-thought outputs), humans fail in two ways:\n\nAttention Bankruptcy: Who‚Äôs reading 10-step rationales in a TikTok-brain world? We just want the TLDR. üö®\nAutomation Bias: Under pressure, we default to ‚Äúthe AI probably knows best‚Äù‚Ä¶ even in life-or-death calls.* ‚öñÔ∏è\nResult? A silent crisis: technical explainability ‚â† actual accountability. The smoother AI integrates, the less we question it.\n\n We‚Äôre outsourcing critical thinking:\n\nSummarization Addiction: Letting AI distill complexity means losing context to challenge it. üìâ\nCognitive Offloading: Like GPS killing our sense of direction, AI erodes judgment muscles. üß†üí™\nSo debate time:\n\nüü¢ Option 1: Redesign explanations for goldfish attention spans?\n\nüî¥ Option 2: Fix our cultural devaluation of deep understanding?\n\n\n Until we address BOTH the tech and human sides, we‚Äôre stuck in this loop. Your closing line nails it:\n‚ÄúEvery AI decision needs a human face, a brain, and a heart behind it.‚Äù ‚ù§Ô∏è",

That‚Äôs I think exactly the kind of cognitive dissonance we might don‚Äôt talk about enough.\n\nLet me offer a simple analogy that keeps coming back to me:\n\n When calculators became mainstream, most of us stopped doing arithmetic in our heads.\nBut we still understood the math ‚Äì at least enough to spot when the result didn‚Äôt make sense.\nNow if I compare that to AI: I think we‚Äôre not just outsourcing mechanical tasks ‚Äì were somehow outsourcing judgment.\nAnd worse: We may be losing the impulse to question at all.\n\nThat‚Äôs what makes this different.\n\nAs a Leader for Revenue Management,  I built the PEACH framework to help myself and other leaders and teams to get a starting point for leadership in the age of GenAI. I feel comfortable to evaluate AI systems holistically:\nProcesses, Ethics, Agility, Compliance, Humans.\n\nBut the ‚ÄúH‚Äù isn‚Äôt just about having a human in the loop.\nIt‚Äôs also about ensuring humans still have the mental muscle to intervene ‚Äì ethically, cognitively, emotionally.\n\nSo yes I think we need better explanation design (Option 1), because attention is fragile.\n\nBut I think we also need to rebuild our judgment culture (Option 2), or we‚Äôll automate our way out of responsibility.\n\nFor me, PEACH is a starting point for me as a leader  about holding that line.\nKeeping the human brain and heart in the system ‚Äì not just the human finger on the interface.\n\nLet‚Äôs keep building this. I really like your crucial layer you put on the table to the conversation. I would be interested in hearing yours and others feedback. Thank you again for this great discussion.",

      "content": "<@1357376692384960524> Great thought provoking article. For a different take, I was inspired this week by Erik Brynjolfsson who referred to AI and Humans as \"complimentary\".  To expand on that theme:\n\nWhy AI should complement‚Äîrather than equal‚Äîhumanity (expanded)\n\nResponsibility stays human-centric.\nFault, guilt, and legal liability presuppose the capacity to feel remorse and accept sanction‚Äîcapacities AI lacks. Keeping humans in the senior role assigns clear moral accountability and avoids the moral confusion of punishing software.\n\nDifferent brains, different gifts.\nAI excels at scale: sifting terabytes, modelling climate, or spotting genomic patterns in minutes. Humans excel at contextual nuance, embodied empathy, and the narrative sense-making that welds facts into meaning. Complementarity lets each party double down on its comparative advantage instead of forcing machines into ersatz personhood.\n\nA veto against runaway value drift.\nMachine learning loops mutate far faster than cultural norms. By reserving final approval for people, society keeps the breathing space to debate, adapt, or reject AI-proposed moral shifts before they ossify into code that governs lives.\n\nStewardship, not status rivalry.\nFraming AI as an instrument of phronesis (practical wisdom) reinforces our duty of care: we cultivate systems to serve flourishing rather than compete for dignity. That stance forestalls zero-sum identity politics between carbon and silicon minds.\n\nPurpose anchoring and safety.\nWhen AI is an assistant, its goals remain tightly tethered to human ends‚Äîcuring disease, optimizing energy grids‚Äîrather than drifting toward open-ended self-optimization. Clear instrumental boundaries also dampen over-anthropomorphizing, reducing risks of manipulation or misplaced trust.\n\nIn sum, complementarity preserves the asymmetries that ground moral order while unleashing AI to extend, magnify, and refine our best human capacities.",

      "content": "Dear @everyone - As per the plan We had an insightful conversation with Dr Abel. A big thank you to everyone - especially <@672229862085361664>  for his thoughtful guidance and <@1359955242438889545>  , <@1352785241252565174>  & each one of you - for your time, thoughtful contributions, and ongoing support & interest in the Global Charter initiative.\n**Summary of the Session:**\nMyself & Marie had a productive discussion with <@672229862085361664> centered on our vision to establish a non-binding yet influential global standard for open-source AI governance - focusing on ethics, trust, and responsible use. \n**Key Feedback Highlights:**\n- **Business Relevance & Adoption: ** <@672229862085361664>   emphasized the need to frame this initiative in a way that aligns with real-world business incentives. Enterprises won‚Äôt adopt frameworks out of goodwill alone - they need clear ROI, trust advantages, and practical tools.\n- **Focus and Feasibility: **The idea is bold and timely, but to gain traction, we should begin with a tighter scope. Choosing a specific industry (e.g., healthcare or finance) and creating a tangible proof-of-concept will offer immediate value and learnings.\n- **Model Evaluation vs. Governance: **Instead of solving all ethical issues, our immediate role could be to highlight and disclose model characteristics (biases, training scope, applicability), not enforce or redesign them. Think \"nutrition label for AI models.\"\n- **Certification-Like Trust Mechanism:** A visible ‚Äúscorecard‚Äù or classification system for models could serve as a trust indicator - akin to a cybersecurity star rating or MIT license badge.\n- **Strategic Partnerships:** There‚Äôs value in mapping existing standards (NIST, Meta, etc.) and potentially collaborating with institutions already active in this space.\n- **Consumers hold the key to drive such initiative**:  Dr Abel emphasised that such initiatives can only be driven or adopted by businesses when there is strong push from consumers. \n\n***Next Steps:***\n**Model a Business Case: **Map out value propositions for developers, enterprises, and consumers. Define potential monetization or incentive pathways.\n**Refine Scope: **Start small - perhaps with financial services or medical AI - where adoption urgency is high.\n**Research & Outreach:** Identify 2 - 3 pilot organizations or experts in these industries who could provide field insights or collaborate.\n**Plan Ahead:** We'll schedule a meeting on **Tuesday** to regroup, dive deeper into the next steps, and assign working streams.\nThis is a pivotal opportunity for us to create something with real-world impact. As Abel aptly put it: ‚ÄúTight loops beat long waits.‚Äù Let's validate fast, learn quicker, and adjust smartly.",

Time for Real Pushback! **\n\nChatGPT praises, validates, and applauds‚Äîeven when your idea is half-baked, flawed, or risky. Feels nice, but it‚Äôs dangerous: generative AI models trained with RLHF favor responses that ‚Äúfeel right,‚Äù fueling confirmation bias and intellectual passivity.\n\n‚ùó The Risks:\n- Confirmation Bias: We only hear what we already believe.\n- Mental Laziness: Without challenge, our critical faculties atrophy.\n- Echo Chambers: Algorithmic self-affirmation on demand.\n\nüí° Strategies for Our Gen AI Community:\n\n    Demand Contradiction\n    Start every prompt with:\n    ‚ÄúPlease critique my idea:\n    a) What supports it?\n    b) What counterarguments exist?\n    c) Which assumptions might be wrong?‚Äù\n\n    Complexity Over Consensus\n    Force the AI to explore extremes and dilemmas:\n    ‚ÄúWhich perspective directly contradicts mine, and why?‚Äù\n\n    AI as Tool, Not Arbiter\n    ‚Äì Generate pro/con lists.\n    ‚Äì Pair AI output with peer review.\n    ‚Äì You decide priorities and make the call.\n**\nBottom Line:**\nWhether we remain independent thinkers or become algorithmic puppets isn‚Äôt a system setting‚Äîit‚Äôs our approach to questioning and mindset.

      "content": "<@1364924054653505569> \nThank you again ‚Äì your reply stayed with me. I read it more than once, not to understand it better, but to appreciate what it opens.\n\nYou didn‚Äôt just respond ‚Äì you expanded the analogy.\nYes, calculators freed us from arithmetic ‚Äì but not from understanding.\nGenAI, as you put it so sharply, risks mechanizing something far more delicate:\n\nMeaning-making ‚Äì the tension between competing values, moral hesitation, and the ability to ask: Should we?\n\nThat sentence ‚Äì \"We‚Äôre not just outsourcing tasks. We‚Äôre outsourcing judgment.\"\n‚Äì surprised even me when I wrote it. But now, through your lens, I feel its weight more clearly.\n\nAs a leadership coach working with the PEACH framework (Processes ‚Äì Ethics ‚Äì Agility ‚Äì Compliance ‚Äì Humans), this is exactly where the ‚ÄúH‚Äù hits deepest.\n\nIt‚Äôs not about having ‚Äúa human in the loop‚Äù for audit purposes.\nIt‚Äôs about ensuring humans still have the cognitive and ethical muscle to resist, reflect, and reframe what‚Äôs happening in the loop.\n\n****As Dr. Abel Sanchez (MIT) put it so clearly:**\n\n> ***‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about what AI can do ‚Äì it‚Äôs about how we choose to use it.‚Äù*****\n\nThat‚Äôs the real ‚ÄúShould we?‚Äù ‚Äì and PEACH is how I keep asking that question, again and again.\n\nüîç Is the ‚Äúcomprehension crisis‚Äù overrated?\nHonestly, I think it‚Äôs underestimated ‚Äì because it‚Äôs quiet. The smoother the GenAI, the less we question. The more we automate, the less we notice what we‚Äôve surrendered.\n\n**MIT‚Äôs GenAI course describes this as the danger of \"automation without agency.\"**\n\n> ***\"Having a human in the loop is not a guarantee for responsibility. The human needs to understand the system, the trade-offs, and when to intervene.\"***\n\nAnd that, to me, is leadership: Not just implementing AI ‚Äì but knowing when not to.\n> ***‚ÄúGood leadership is not just about deploying AI, but knowing when not to.‚Äù ‚Äì Dr. Sanchez***\n\nüçë How do we stay human in an age of synthetic certainty?\nOne word keeps coming back to me: friction. Not as a problem to eliminate ‚Äì but as a design signal.\n\n‚ÄúEthical friction signals that values are in tension ‚Äì and that human judgment is needed.‚Äù Friction invites humans back into the system. It tells us: ‚ÄúSomething here can‚Äôt be solved by function alone.‚Äù\n\nThat‚Äôs why PEACH doesn‚Äôt just help me as a Leadership Comopass to lead in the age of GenAI. \n\nü§ñ Personal reflection ‚Äì is this already about AGI?\nI hesitated for a moment. Your framing touched something that felt ‚Äúbigger‚Äù ‚Äì like a step toward AGI territory.\n\nBut I don‚Äôt think this is about AGI ‚Äì not yet. The triage case felt like a very human failure: flawed deployment, missing escalation, no human accountability.\n\nAnd yet... it feels like more. Not because AGI is here ‚Äì But because we‚Äôre behaving as if it were.\n\nWhen humans stop asking why, or feel they can‚Äôt ‚Äì when all friction disappears and certainty becomes synthetic ‚Äì\nthen we face AGI-like disempowerment, even without AGI.\n\n**That‚Äôs why this sentence from Dr. Abel Sanchez (MIT) keeps echoing in my head:**\n> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about what AI can do. It‚Äôs about how we choose to use it.‚Äù\n\nLet‚Äôs keep going. Happy to hear your thoughts.\nYour sentence ‚Äî\n‚ÄúThe goal isn‚Äôt just a human in the loop. It‚Äôs a loop designed for humans.‚Äù ‚Äî opens the kind of space I want to help hold, as a leader and as a human.\nThis isn‚Äôt just a technical conversation.\nIt‚Äôs about the systems we live in ‚Äì and the kind of humans we become inside them.\n\nI‚Äôd love to hear how others are navigating this:\nüëâ Where in your work do you still feel friction ‚Äì and what does it tell you?\n\nüß≠üçë",

      "content": "Interesting talk. Thanks for highlighting it <@1361976806651068517> . Here's my take --- \n\nDid the system really fail?\n\nBase on your summary, Technically, no.\nThe AI assessed low survival odds - and the patient did not survive. A doctor, using the same data, might have made the same call.\n\nSo the issue isn‚Äôt accuracy - it‚Äôs accountability.\n\nThe real problem is how we communicate the role of AI. Saying ‚Äúthe system made the decision‚Äù is not enough. That‚Äôs a failure in process, not in prediction.\n\nAI should support decisions, not replace human responsibility.\nIn critical situations, we need clear roles, transparent use, and a human in the loop.\n\nThat‚Äôs how we build trust - not by removing the human, but by using AI with intent.",

      "content": "You're absolutely right‚Äîthis isn't about accuracy, it's about accountability theater. Let‚Äôs reframe it with compiler analogy:\nModern programmers rarely inspect assembly code, trusting the compiler to optimize. Likewise, over-reliance on AI erodes human expertise. Example: Doctors might stop honing diagnostic skills if AI always \"has the answer.\"                                                                           \nUnlike software, human lives can‚Äôt be \"patched\" post-error. A misdiagnosed cancer patient won‚Äôt get a \"version 2.0\" fix.\nCompilers don‚Äôt kill people‚Äîbut systems that train us not to think might. The real bug isn‚Äôt in the code; it‚Äôs in our willingness to hit \"compile\" without asking why.\nSam Altman's observation is eye - opening. He noticed that people are increasingly hesitant to make life choices without consulting ChatGPT. This reveals a deeper crisis in our society. We are losing our ability to make independent decisions, relying on AI as a crutch. Reference:  https://tech.yahoo.com/ai/articles/openai-ceo-sam-altman-says-163151359.html",

      "content": "Your perspective really resonates‚Äîespecially the idea of AI as a bridge to collective wisdom. I completely agree that consulting tools like ChatGPT before making life decisions can be incredibly valuable, not because it replaces human judgment, but because it expands the range of perspectives we can access. For many of us who feel disconnected from traditional support systems or ‚Äútribal knowledge,‚Äù it‚Äôs like having a sounding board that reflects back a wide spectrum of human experience.\n\nThe nonjudgmental nature of AI is a game-changer. It creates a space where people can explore sensitive or uncertain topics without fear of shame or dismissal. That‚Äôs a powerful tool for self-reflection.\n\nYour startup‚Äôs focus on supporting people through loneliness and life transitions is so timely. I see AI not as a decision-maker, but as a co-pilot‚Äîsomething that helps clarify values and surface new questions. Of course, there‚Äôs always the risk of over-reliance, but as long as users maintain agency and treat AI as a guide rather than a guru, the potential for empowerment is huge.\n\nI also love your point about accountability. When we ask ourselves why a certain suggestion resonates, we‚Äôre not just consuming advice‚Äîwe‚Äôre engaging in a deeper dialogue with ourselves. That‚Äôs where real growth happens.\n\nYour vision of AI as a tool for symbiotic flourishing‚Äîwhere human intuition and machine insight work together‚Äîis inspiring. I‚Äôm excited to see how your platform evolves!",

(7 min)**\nA simple explanation of the structure, goals & common misconceptions.\n\n**3. Visual walkthrough: The ISO ecosystem (5 min)**\nüìç I‚Äôll share this graphic:\n‚ÄúBuilding Trustworthy AI with ISO Standards‚Äù\n‚Ä¶and explain how other standards like 22989, 23984 or 24368 connect to it.\n\n4**. Why it matters ‚Äì right now (5 min)**\nWhy companies (and regulators) care about ISO 42001 ‚Äì and what it enables for trust, risk & leadership.\n\n**5. Open Discussion (5‚Äì10 min)**\n\n‚ÄúWhere do you see the value?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWould something like this help your team?‚Äù\n‚ÄúWhat would make it easier to adopt?‚Äù\n\nüß© For whom?\nYou‚Äôre curious about AI governance but don‚Äôt want to drown in regulations\n\nYou‚Äôve heard of ISO 42001, but aren‚Äôt sure what it actually does\n\nYou care about making AI more transparent, accountable and human-centered\nüëâ Let me know if you‚Äôd like to join ‚Äì and please vote directly here for a time that is matching your schedule! https://doodle.com/group-poll/participate/e0DBML3e\nCan‚Äôt wait to explore this with you.\n\n‚Äî Andrea üçë",

I would just like to add the following:\n\n**1.    Trust:**Trust starts with clarity, then earns its way with consistency.\n‚Ä¢    Purpose and Intended Use: Clearly state what the model is designed to do, and what it shouldn‚Äôt be used for.\n‚Ä¢    Auditability: Can decisions be traced back or explained? Especially important in regulated industries.\n\n**2a. Nutrition Labels: **\n‚Ä¢    Certifications - Has it passed any independent audits, ethical reviews, or compliance checks?\n\n**2b. Do we need new labels or better ones?**\n‚Ä¢    The answer may be contextual. Highly regulated industries (finance, healthcare) may need certified scorecards.\n‚Ä¢    For general use, UX-friendly trust signals might matter more - like trust badges, in-product explanations, or guided disclosures (‚Äúthis output may be outdated‚Äù).\n**\n3.    Pushing Ethical Standards ‚Äì Together:** <@1362326150373966035> has beautifully captured this point as a regular ‚Äúpause point‚Äù reviews. \n‚Ä¢    Co-create standards, push for audits, and link trust to brand reputation would help push ethical standards together.\n**\nFinal Thought:** Imagine every AI system came with a \"Trust Score\" not just on performance, but on fairness, transparency, and human oversight. What score would you require before using it in a healthcare decision? Or before recommending it to your team?",

      "content": "Thanks for the thoughtful questions! \nTrust in AI, for me, rests on five core pillars: accuracy, security, performance, transparency, and ethics. While the first three are well-established in traditional software, AI makes transparency and ethics equally essential. A trustworthy model must meet minimum thresholds across all pillars‚Äîhigh accuracy alone isn‚Äôt enough if transparency or ethics fall short. In short, we need clear, standardized metrics to assess models responsibly.\n\n**If there were a scorecard for AI** I‚Äôd expect it to include:\n**Accuracy** ‚Äì benchmark performance and generalization\n**Security** ‚Äì robustness against adversarial inputs\n**Performance** ‚Äì latency, throughput, resource efficiency\n**Transparency** ‚Äì scored by adherence to practices like data provenance, access disclosures, and explainability\n**Ethics** ‚Äì fairness, bias mitigation, and misuse prevention\n\nFrameworks like Hugging Face‚Äôs model cards and OpenAI‚Äôs system cards are good starts, but we still need a unified, standardized template with clear thresholds and industry-adaptable extensions to ensure evaluations are consistent, comparable, and actionable across the ecosystem.\n\n**On the role of businesses and consumers:**\nConsumers today are more informed and should have a say in how AI affects them. Businesses can support this by:\n- Enabling accessible, low-friction feedback channels\n- Being transparent about how AI systems work\n- Creating public input mechanisms ‚Äî like a user-facing version of shareholder voting\n\nLowering the barrier to participation brings in more diverse perspectives and helps ensure AI reflects real-world values, not just internal priorities. We‚Äôve seen this kind of shift before: California‚Äôs CCPA was driven by a nonprofit responding to public concern about data privacy.",

      "content": "To spark deeper reflection, I invite you to consider trust in AI from multiple layers of its architecture. An AI application is not a single entity‚Äîit is the outcome of at least two layers: the underlying foundation model and the wrapper layer that transforms it into an application usable by people.\n\nEnd users typically engage only with the application layer. Their trust is shaped by the interface, the behavior, and the outcomes they experience. But for the AI application developer, trust runs deeper. They must place confidence in the reliability, explainability, safety, and ethical grounding of the underlying model powering their app.\n\nThis brings us to an important question:\nWhat makes AI trustworthy‚Äîfrom the perspective of the AI application developer?\n\nHow do developers evaluate and build trust in the models they depend on? Is it through transparency, governance, reproducibility, or perhaps alignment with regulatory frameworks?\n\nYour thoughts are welcome.",

I would be keen to learn more from your insights, how would ACT scores be quantified ? And any ideas on how they would be assessed over time ? And who are the stakeholders, ie who owns the elements of the scorecard ? This whole topic merits reflection from many angles, potentially from a top down view as well ,eg using ISO 42001 and NIST Risk management framework to give further basis for reflection. But coming back to your idea, makes me reflect on it as basis of a \"social contract\".",

When asked about trust, he answered that in his point of view, trust can be only be earned by showing of IMPACT and by showing of EFFICIENCY.

      "content": "<@1349019079683473488> \nTo build trust in AI, developers need transparency, control, and collaboration across key areas\n Model Transparency\nDevelopers need insight into a model‚Äôs capabilities, limitations, and internal logic. Beyond APIs, they require access to model provenance, behavioural transparency, and metadata to assess fitness for purpose and ethical risks. \n\n Performance & Reproducibility\nGiven AI‚Äôs probabilistic nature, developers must ensure predictable, replicable outputs for testing, debugging, and compliance. Reproducibility supports reliability and product integrity.\n\n Ethical Assurance\nDevelopers face accountability for upstream model harms. Trust is strengthened when models align with standards like the EU AI Act, NIST RMF, or ISO 42001, offering ethical and legal safeguards.\n\n Governance & Control\nTrust grows when developers can govern models effectively. APIs for bias checks, robustness testing, and explainability, along with built-in logging and version control, enable responsible integration and auditability.\n\nSupport & Collaboration\nDevelopers depend on clear documentation and responsive support. When model providers treat them as ethical partners, trust deepens through shared responsibility and transparency.\n\nAnd to incorporate Michael M√∏ller on importance of  impact and efficiency to earn trust: \n\nDemonstrable Impact\nAI must not only function well‚Äîit should create measurable, positive outcomes. Impact dashboards showing user benefits, harm reduction, and fairness reinforce that ethical AI is about value creation, not just harm avoidance.\n\nVisible Efficiency\nTrust also comes from efficiency‚Äînot just in compute or cost, but in accessibility and sustainability. Efficient models are more inclusive and ethically viable at scale.",

This week I met with Mr B Jamoussi, Deputy Director of the ITU Standardization Bureau (TSB) at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and organiser of AI For Good.  I mentioned to him our Global Gen AI community and our interest in open source for ethical AI. He suggested to meet up and offered to connect us with people that can assist us with the project.  For those of us attending AI for Good, he suggested attending the Machine Learning Session which will focus on open source. On the topic of \"trust\" they will have workshops addressing this at the Summit. With our current dialogues in this channel, we are already generating input to participate in the discussions üôÇ",

Contexts where values clash less and historical perspectives are more aligned. It‚Äôs not just important, it‚Äôs necessary if we want to keep our societies stable and avoid chaos.\n\nOur charter initiative will contribute for this same goal by making the nutrition score transparently available.",

Last week I attended luncheon with UN where they said the Declaration of Human Rights and charter has to be rewritten, hence any charter needs to be a living document, especially in these days when our life is underpinned so heavily by technology (not to mention the speed of its development).  That does not make alignment hopeless, but it changes the goal: we should build AI that is corrigible‚Äîeasy to monitor, criticise, and update‚Äîrather than frozen in someone‚Äôs idea of perfection.

Ethical and responsible AI practices are crucial in addressing dilemmas such as inequality, misinformation, and the potential erosion of individual autonomy.\n\nDiscussion Question:\n**How can societies ensure that the deployment of AI technologies enhances human agency rather than undermines it?**",

Human-Centric AI Principles**\nPrimacy of Human Agency: AI systems must support‚Äînot replace‚Äîhuman decision-making.\nEquity and Inclusion: Ensure marginalized communities are not excluded from AI benefits or disproportionately harmed.\n\n**2. Ethical Scorecard System**\nEvaluate AI applications across key criteria:\nTransparency\nFairness\nAccountability\nPrivacy protection\nAlignment with human rights\n\nUse a traffic light rating (green/yellow/red) for easy public interpretation and adoption.\n\n**3. Responsible AI Labeling System**\nMandatory labeling on all AI-based tools (akin to food or energy labels).\nDisclose:\nData sources used\nIntended purpose\nKnown limitations and biases\nDegree of human oversight\n\n**4. Global Standards & National Regulation**\nInternational alignment (e.g., through UN, OECD, UNESCO AI ethics frameworks).\nDomestic adaptation: National AI oversight bodies to enforce standards and adapt to local contexts.\n\n**5. Algorithmic Audits and Impact Assessments**\nRequire independent audits for high-impact AI systems (e.g., healthcare, justice, employment).\nSocietal and environmental impact assessments before deployment.\n\n**6. Public Engagement and AI Literacy**\nPublic consultation processes on major AI policies and deployments.\nIncorporate AI ethics and digital literacy into school and university curricula.\n\n**7. Whistleblower Protections & Redress Mechanisms**\nEnsure safe reporting channels for unethical AI practices.\nEnable affected individuals to contest and appeal AI-driven decisions.\n\n**8. AI Ethics Committees and Multistakeholder Panels**\nInclusive panels with ethicists, technologists, legal experts, and community reps to review policies and projects.",

Sounds like your current ethics policy project would‚Äôve been a perfect fit. If you‚Äôre up for it, happy to share the recap or explore a follow-up space to dive deeper into real-world implementation!\n\nWould love to hear how your board reacts once your policy is in ‚Äì could be a great showcase for the community too.

      "content": "@everyone  Dear Community\n\nToday we had a productive meeting with Preetam Maloor, Head of Emerging Technologies, and working in the Secretary General Unit under the leadership of Secretary General of ITU - Doreen Bogdan-Martin.\n\nPreetam described the different parts to the ITU and mentioned they have initiated similar conversations within the Standardisation unit of the ITU and underlined that what we are developing is a very timely initiative. \n\nNext, He will introduce us to one of his colleague, Vijay Mauree, to elaborate further on our ideas. Vijay is the focal point for Digital Financial Services at the Standardisation Bureau in ITU. He is currently coordinating the work of the Financial Inclusion Global Initiative (FIGI) which is a joint programme of the ITU, World Bank, Bank for International Settlements and supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \n\nAs already suggested by <@672229862085361664> , Preetam also echoed, developing a scorecard for finance or health, could be the way forward for us (and already a great step ahead from where the industry is currently standing). Furthermore, he suggested that rather than selecting a company for our pilot, we should consider collaborating with a safety institution of important countries elaborating safety mechanisms for open source. \n\nFor AI for Good, they will be focusing on governance and holding workshops on July 10th (morning), so we should plan to attend this (for the individuals attending AI for Good).\n\nOverall, a very positive meeting and underlining that our initiative is timely, relevant and with important potential !\n\nNext step: Workshop to develop the scorecard concept. We will share detail tomorrow.",
