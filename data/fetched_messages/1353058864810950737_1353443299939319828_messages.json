I’m Andrea, based in Munich and me favorite emoji is 🍑 . I am super excited to be part of this Buddy Group. 🎯 Why I’m in this community: I’m on a learning journey to deepen my leadership in the age of GenAI & Agents – especially as a non-tech person navigating AI transformation in B2B. I'm passionate about shaping future-ready Revenue Engines and will soon dive into Python basics (because yes… debugging without it is humbling 😉). 🔍 What drives me:\nExploring how GenAI affects Processes, Ethics, Agility, Compliance, and Human impact – or, as I call it thankx to the input of <@673901899837341736> , my “PEACH” Leadership Compass.

Thanks Malin for launching the intro's. 👍 \n 🎯  With a background in management consulting, finance/private banking, and launch of a fintech (first digital private bank in Switzerland), Im a firm believer of digital transformation and would like to advise boards and starts ups on their GenAI and agentic transformations.  Im also a believer of technology transformation and the good it can derive in terms of democratising access and levelling the playing field for more to have access , compete and shape their lives in the world we are living in today and for our next generation !\nLooking forward to learning together and hopefully have some fun moments too 😆 `",

I’ve spent the past 15 years leading marketing, growth, and communications strategies across EMEA for global professional services organizations (with a focus on digital transformation).\n\nLately, I’ve been really interested in the practical side of AI—especially how we can:\n    1.    integrate it into marketing strategies by enhancing planning, targeting, and campaign execution,\n    2.    rethink how we work by redesigning workflows, collaboration, and creative processes, and\n    3.    improve core marketing operations, from content creation to personalization and decision-making.\n\nA big part of what matters to me is how we build and maintain trust with clients and ensure brand safety as we start integrating GenAI into more customer-facing areas.\n\nReally looking forward to connecting with you all and sharing ideas as we learn together! ✨",

      "content": "Hi <@1364826411566764043>, thanks for bringing this up – that’s a really relevant and timely angle, especially with the EU AI Act moving into implementation.\n\nOne idea I would like to share: we might slightly reframe the question to invite a more technical take – for example, what kind of design or architectural choices could actually support enforcement, beyond policy intent?\n\nSomething like:\n“The EU AI Act is often criticized for weak enforcement mechanisms. From a technical or architectural perspective, what innovations or system-level designs could make such regulations more enforceable in practice?”\n\nThat could open the floor for insights on auditability, explainability, or even cultural implementation – areas Dr. Sanchez often highlights.\n\nWhat do you think – would that resonate with the spirit of your question?",

      "content": "Hi Laure! Thanks for your intro!  \nI think it is super interesting with the customer facing AI usage as well. To launch that, one really needs to consider its audience. Some will like it, some will absolutely not like it. Also, customers and especially consumers will be judgemental - one bad experience will have effect for a really long time with a client and they will likely also complain to others, quickly leading to effects on the brand. \n\nSomeone wrote in one of the bigger groups or in the course forums (can’t remember) about creating almost emotionally intelligent AIs based on historic data so the AI  answer in a tone that resonates with the person (who might eg be upset about something). Too happy tone might annoy but striking the balance of that is very interesting!",

I run digitalization and organization transformation initiatives as a program and project manager. I am focused on the financial services industry (banks, insurance companies), for which I have worked with different angles: in Consulting, within a bank, and with a Fintech. \nI was thrilled to do the ‘Applied GenAI for Digital Transformation” MIT course. It brought me new perspectives and a deepened understanding. I believe it brought me to the point where I can jump to the next level of applying GenAI in business and projects. Making sure to exploit new potentials for digitalization and running transformation initiatives. \nI would love to exchange with you in this group and continue to learn together about how to best exploit GenAI. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me. You also find me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rene-m-jost/ \nBest regards \nRené  😃",

Thanks for the suggestion <@1359955242438889545> I will get that recording going. \n\nSo far I have built very simple GPTs in ChatGPT. One relates to calculating a specific date which was surprisingly difficult. I think my main learning from that was that less is more. As we learned from the course we should give it the bigger picture rather than narrowing its mind to one’s own perspective. \n\nThat is also an important thing to keep in mind for building agents. The first one I am about to kick off is a crossword assistant.  There I said it, so I will have to report back now. 😄🤝",

      "content": "Hey team,\n\nReally enjoyed the session with Abel and John today!\n\nOne thing that stuck with me was the point about “less is more,” especially when we’re all using tools like ChatGPT. It can be super helpful, but also risky if we just keep building on long threads or documents without stepping back - it will be interesting when we see big cases where this has financial and legal effects. It is also an important reminder to managers to train people early in their careers (and others too perhaps) that that they are accountable for the output. \n\nI am interested in the security bit and I saw you had a question about that too <@1359955242438889545>. If anyone’s read something good on that, send it my way! \n\nHave an awesome Friday!",

      "content": "Totally agree with the points raised so far especially around the need for orchestration and AI literacy. One thing that really stands out to me from my own experience in large, complex, matrixed organizations is just how hard it is to map workflows end to end. Processes are often informal, undocumented, spread across teams and no one fully owns them.\n\nBringing AI agents into that kind of environment actually forces reflection and clarity upfront. You can’t hand over a task to an agent if you don’t fully understand the handoffs, decision points, or who’s accountable. So before we get to orchestration or oversight, maybe the real first step is untangling and documenting those grey areas.\n\nCurious if anyone’s found effective ways to do this.",

I have been sick for the last 10 days and I still will need to recover until the end of the week. Incredible how low you can get physically in just a few days! I hope to be able to be back to you guys at the end of this week and see for next steps. I am continuing my thoughts around the Goverance space. And I am also planning to start a practical case, which is a learning for me and where I hope to get the community's thoughts and inputs as well. \nTalk soon! \nRené",
