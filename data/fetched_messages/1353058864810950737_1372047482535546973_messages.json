      "content": "@everyone\n\nWe’re excited to launch a new channel: <#1372047482535546973> \nThis will be the dedicated spot for all enrollment announcements for our Agents Development  Class—opening dates, links to apply, and key deadlines.\n\n🔔 Turn on notifications here to “all messages” so you never miss an enrollment window!\n\nOur next cohort sign‑up just went live—details are in the first post below.👇\n\n📌 Cohort Sign-Ups Now Open!\n\n🎯 Agents Development Class (formerly Discord Managers Program) – Beta Launch\n\nCommunity-Wide Launch: Sunday, May 26\n\nApplications Open: Tonight (May 13)\n\nThis hands-on program guides you from zero coding experience to creating your own Gen AI agents on Discord. Developed with Dr. Sanchez, Oscar Sanchez, MIT affiliates, and industry experts.\n\nHow to Apply: “https://forms.fillout.com/t/gS4BK7H7E4us\n\n{Fill out the form in the attached link}\n\nAn advanced AI-driven matching system, designed by Oscar and the team, will analyze your input (cognitive patterns, availability, skill level) and intelligently place you into an optimal peer group.\n\nWhat Happens Next: You won’t be placed into the Agent Dev class immediately. Instead, on Saturday, May 17th, you’ll gain access to the Gen AI Non-Coders Learning Group while you wait until may 26th. This is not a prep course—it’s a discovery layer in our pipeline. The goal is to observe your interaction style, gather learning behavior data, and give you access to interactive workshops, no-code tools, and prompt design sessions that enrich your profile for better cohort placement and give you additional learning in the meantime. You’ll start learning, engaging, and building alongside others—while our AI refines the best cohort match for you.",
