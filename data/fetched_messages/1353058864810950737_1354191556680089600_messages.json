      "content": "Turned a Boring Weekend into a chaotic coding weekend saga! üíª‚ú®\n\nLet‚Äôs be real-I spent 70% of this weekend yelling ‚ÄúWHY AREN‚ÄôT YOU WORKING?!‚Äù at my screen, But I just had one of those weekends where you look back and think ‚ÄúWow, I actually built something from scratch!‚Äù I dove headfirst into creating my website `machinecognition.ai` (RIP, domain squatters - Why the name? Cuz it's AI, lol. I registered this name for a different idea, but started here anyway).  \n\nShoutout to Cursor for being my coding copilot and **vibe coding** for convincing me that 3am debugging sessions are ~~totally normal~~. The site‚Äôs currently held together by digital duct tape (one button literally opens a portal to the void üï≥Ô∏è), and my blog drafts look like a GPT-3 fever dream. But hey-progress over perfection, right?\n\nKey takeaways:\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Vibe coding are like IKEA furniture: looks easy until you‚Äôre left with 17 mysterious screws.\n2Ô∏è‚É£ `npm run build` and *commit to main* should come with a warning label.\n3Ô∏è‚É£ The real MVP? My coffee maker.\n\nIf a guy who once formatted his entire hard drive trying to install Python can build something, so can you. What‚Äôs your current ‚ÄúI have no idea what I‚Äôm doing‚Äù passion project? Let‚Äôs swap war stories! üî•\n\nTagging my emotional support rubber duck ü¶Ü for moral contribution.\n\nLet me know what you think of my website - https://machinecognition.ai",

The team consists of a Subject Matter Expert (Sam), Business Analyst (Bea), Product Designer (David), Senior Front End Engineer (Will), Senior Back End Engineer (Lucy), QA (Alan), AI Product Strategist (Aidan), Commercial and Marketing Strategist (Travis). I provided the vision for product and the broad objectives, thereafter I've been orchestrating conversations between the experts, giving direction on decision points, drafting, reviewing, critiquing and improving product docs eg. PRD (Product Requirements), AI Strategy, Go To Market Strategy. Will (Front End) has been building prototypes in React which you can preview through ChatGPT - the team have been providing feedback and iterating. It's really addictive.\nPrior to this I've probably been too optimistic and leapt straight into building solutions on the fly with mixed outcomes. I'm hoping this replication of a real team of experts at work will deliver better fundamentals on which to build a stronger product.",

A more automated, layered approach is something that we can consider. However, one of my main goals was to avoid turning this Copilot into a \"product\" that demands continuous maintenance, which could easily become a full-time job internally. For me.\n\n**Agentic approach**\n‚Äî\nI think your idea is freaking outstanding.\nAt the same time, I would flag the same concern: the more agentic and autonomous the system, the higher the operational burden in practice. Continuous learning, CRM integration, roadmapping, feedback loops.. all of these are valuable, but they also add significant ongoing complexity. For now, keeping the scope tight keeps it off \"Francisco's plate\".",

      "content": "Hey <@1350111040733577246> thanks for sharing. RFPs has been a use case I've been thinking about as well. My role wasn't in Sales but I know RFPs can be time consuming and definitely a high value use for AI. I'd be interested to know more about your approach.\n\nJust a quick braindump from me on what I was thinking:\n- You receive an RFP from a client interested in your product outlining a number of capabilities that they want fulfilled by a successful vendor. \n- Sales do an initial opportunity qualification based on client fit, strategic value, forecast growth and revenue, competitors, likelihood of win, available resource etc\n- Sales Engineers perform a gap analysis between the client's required capabilities and the current platform identifying existing capabilities (internal knowledge stores), planned capabilities (roadmap) and gaps\n- Sales then respond to the RFP in the required format, which can be different for every client - weaving the narrative for why our product is the best fit for the organisation - strategically, commercially, economically etc\n\nAn agentic approach:\n- An input agent which consumes and extracts key information from the RFP\n- Qualification agent which can access CRM, websearch and produce indicative scoring\n- Gap Analysis agent which can compare the RFP to internal knowledge stores - categorising required capabilities into existing, planned, unplanned\n- Response agent which can draft the response taking into account above outputs\n- Learning agent - taking feedback from win/loss metrics in order to improve overtime\n\nI'm not sure if this is grossly oversimplifying the process üòÇ",

      "content": "Hey everyone, \n\nI've been debating sharing on this forum as what I did now feels \"simple\" and \"basic\", when at the time of doing felt \"hard\" and \"hard to achieve\". However, here goes nothing.\n\nBeing in the space of Enterprise Financial Planning and Analysis, I was required by my superiors to create an AI Sales Copilot that would enable our sales teams and the sales teams of our business partners to be completely aligned on the promises of each of our products (we sell 4 products) and accelerate the process of answering RFPs ‚Äî not answering the RFPs! But being able to answer an RFP rather fast.\n\nBecause accurately answering RFPs was a key requirement of this project, eliminating hallucinations was also a key requirement.\n\nAnother challenge was \"how do people interact with this Sales Copilot\"? The Sales Copilot was built as a Discord Bot as we can retain complete control over who joins (and stays) in the Discord Server.\n\nThe whole process took me about 3 hours and I did in one evening with the faithful support of GPT-4o. \n\nThe stack looks like this:\n\n- OpenAI 's GPT-4 Turbo powers the language generation.\n- Pinecone handles vector search, allowing retrieving the right documentation fragments. I was told it has the tendency to become expensive. Let's see.\n- Discord serves as the front-end as a clean environment that supports private access, team collaboration, and separation by product line.\n- Render hosts our FastAPI backend, with auto-deploy from GitHub for smooth updates.\n- Make ensures the service stays warm, pinging our /status endpoint every five minutes to avoid cold starts.\n\n\nThe good\n‚Äî\nIt's alive! It works. People are using it.\nAnd it doesn't hallucinate.\n\n\nThe \"meh\"\n‚Äî\nIt sometimes spits out errors that I don't really know how to fix so I need to iterate solutions.\nChanging the temperature does not affect answers (probably a good thing).\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n‚Äî\nIf the documentation you're putting in the RAG isn't great, the bot won't be great.",

      "content": "Hi @everyone !üëã  Thrilled to introduce **ArchiDrawGPT**‚Äîan AI agent built to support enterprise architects and anyone stepping into architecture modeling.\n\nArchitecture models are essential for large enterprises‚Äîthey align strategy, processes, and technology. But creating them, especially following TOGAF and ArchiMate standards, can be complex and time-consuming.\n\nI built *ArchiDrawGPT* from a deep desire to bring GenAI into serious architectural work‚Äîgiving a helping hand to junior and medior architects, and making it easier for anyone to create solid architecture models. This frees up expert architects to focus on solving critical business challenges instead of getting stuck in diagrams.\n\nEver paused and asked yourself, is this a business service or an application service? Or should this be modeled as a capability or a process? These aren‚Äôt just technical questions‚Äîthey shape how organizations see and solve problems. ArchiDrawGPT helps navigate these choices and makes modeling more accessible. Attached is an example architecture diagram generated by *ArchiDrawGPT* for credit lending.\n\nBuilding this tool showed me AI‚Äôs potential to make enterprise architecture smarter and more inclusive.\n\nTry it out here: [https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6803803bd90c8191aa5d78df4484e739-archidrawgpt]\nI‚Äôd love your feedback and ideas! Building ArchiDrawGPT also taught me a lot about AI‚Äôs limits & the messy challenges. There‚Äôs more to explore, and I‚Äôd love your feedback, thoughts, or ideas.",
