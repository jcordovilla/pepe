So if you're a product/programme lead in FS or healthcare, you can spark those threads and collaborate within context.\n\nAlso, just to clarify: that's exactly what the <#1373042811318046802>  channel is for! If you (or anyone else) sees a need for a new channel industry or General chat chat concept inclusion <#1372397860980658327> this is where you can propose it for approval. We're building it with you all in mind.\n\nJust to make it easier for our governance team, lets continue the conversation in <#1354188981826228448> !\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you submit!",

      "content": "Thanks <@1352785241252565174>  - we could manage this adhoc in threads within the industry channels but here's my pitch for a channel. I think there may be value in cross-industry collaboration around certain disciplines with the theory that product/project managers often deal with fundamentally similar challenges regardless of the sector. I understand the desire to not have too many channels but I guess eventually we should be able to pick and choose which channels to join? The more important thing is making sure we try and avoid multiple channels trying to tackle the same problems. So putting this out there for consideration:\n\n🚀 Proposal: New Channel – Product & Programme Management\n\nI’d love to propose a new channel focused on the Product & Programme Management discipline in the context of AI adoption in financial services. This space would be for those of us driving or planning AI initiatives—from idea to execution.\n\n👥 Who’s it for?\nProduct Managers, Programme/Project Managers, and anyone leading the delivery of AI capabilities in FS.\n\n🎯 Why this channel?\nTo dig into the specific challenges of managing AI delivery—like aligning with compliance, scaling MVPs, cross-team collaboration, tool selection, and more. We’ll share experiences, tackle roadblocks together, and design better ways forward.\n\n📦 What will we create together?\nToolkits: e.g., delivery playbooks, MVP checklists, AI compliance templates\nFrameworks: for governance, delivery alignment, and agile execution\nCase studies & lessons learned\nBest practices using current tools\nCommunity-built solutions to shared problems\n\n🎯 What do we aim to achieve?\nStronger, risk-aware AI delivery practices\nMore confidence navigating complexity in AI delivery\nHigher success rates for AI initiatives by learning from each other\n\nIf you’re interested in building this with me, drop a 👍 or your thoughts below! Would love to co-create this with peers who care about getting AI into production responsibly and effectively.",

And of course: I am open for others! \n*Confirmed engagement: <@1364721820313456643> *\n\n**Piloting Context/Industry:**\nSwitzerland is officially multilingual—**German, French, Italian, English**, and more\n👉 SMEs here (99.7% of companies) can benefit immediately from accessible, inclusive AI solutions.\n\nℹ** Getting Started with Slow-AI **\n1. We could choose one feature or model to pilot.  \n2. We could design a two-week test with success criteria and user interviews.  \n3. We could schedule a mid-pilot ethics “pause point” to review early data.  \n4. We could plan a modular rollout (e.g., phase 1 = English; phase 2 = add German or French).  \n5. We could set up a simple dashboard for explainability logs or “Why?” queries.  \n\nPS: my proposal came in late. Keep an eye on time zones and week days.😜",

Focusing on structured, phased pilots with built-in ethics checkpoints and monitoring dashboards lead to more trustworthy AI. In a nutshell Slow AI is focusing less on speed and more on depth, nuance, and human-centric design. More via DM.",

The goal is to create a space where we can share practical use cases, learn from each other, and build things that matter.\n\nTo illustrate: I’m currently based in Peru, and across LATAM I’ve seen incredible grassroots innovation — startups using augmented reality, early-stage GenAI solutions, and more. But what if we could take it a step further?\n\n✨ Imagine launching a Global AI Impact Lab — powered by this amazing community — to connect visionary leaders with students and early professionals. A space to train talent, build real solutions, and drive social and economic transformation in regions that need it most.\n\nThis could be a place for prototyping, sharing tools, testing ideas, and scaling what works.\n\nLet’s turn learning into action — together.",

However, what I’m proposing goes one step further: rather than just exchanging ideas or showcasing use cases, the IA Lab would be a space to co-create, prototype, and actually implement real-world solutions with a diverse group — students, researchers, professionals, and community members alike.\n\nIt’s less about broadcasting applications and more about building them together through a structured, collaborative framework.\n\nThat said, I’m totally open to exploring how this could align or complement existing channels. Maybe it can evolve as a special initiative or spin-off within the community if there's interest.",

The existing channels already congregate people (experts and novice) based on their interest.  Posting or inviting others to contribute within existing channels, within their sphere of interest  has greater chance of amassing  diverse perspectives and in my view, has a greater chance of gaining steam, because the  channel is active and people are interested in the topic (of that channel), and might offer insights and contributions that might not surface up if this was posted in 'proposals' dedicated channel. \nTake a look at the <#1353448986408779877>  channel, the idea to build a Trust AI nutrition  label, and  Global Charter for Ethical AI came through organic conversations. \nThe non-coder initiative also came out of organic conversations.   \nSimilarly within <#1354190157049364501> there are invitations to explore different tools together and we had a session on \"Navigating the AI Agent Deployment and Costs Options!\"\n  \nAnyway, am curious what others think...",
