While the site is still in its early stages, the agent-powered repository is already live and accessible as we continue building out the platform and adding more resources.\n\nYou can check out the repository here: https://genaiglobal.org/resources.html\n\n⚠️Going forward, this will be the official home for all Gen AI Global resources.\nIf you’re looking for slides, guides, documentation, recordings, or key community tools—this is where you’ll find them⚠️\n\nThis channel will serve as the permanent access point to the repository, which will be updated regularly as our work evolves.\n\nBookmark it, use it, and share it—we’re building this for you.\n\nStay tuned—this is just the beginning!",
