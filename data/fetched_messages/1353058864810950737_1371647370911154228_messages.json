Irene brought energy, initiative, and passion to her involvement, and we are grateful for the time and effort she dedicated.\n\nAs we continue to nurture this community around shared values of collaboration, curiosity, and inclusive growth, we‚Äôve mutually agreed that Irene will be stepping away from her role. While we may at times take different paths, we remain committed to fostering a culture where all voices can thrive within a spirit of alignment and mutual support.\n\nPlease feel free to DM me ¬†if you have any questions. Let‚Äôs continue building something extraordinary together.\n\nWarmly,\nDragana",

Our goal is to ensure the Non-Coders program becomes a seamless foundation leading into the Agent Development Program for Discord 2.0‚Äîoffering everyone a natural, supportive learning journey.\n\nWe‚Äôll also be announcing a dedicated meeting soon to walk you through next steps and answer questions live. In the meantime, if you have any doubts or would like to connect, feel free to DM me directly anytime.\n\nThanks so much for your understanding, enthusiasm, and continued support!\n\nRodrigo Reyes",

      "content": "Dear @Non-Coders Community,\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we‚Äôd like to share a few updates on the next steps for this group. After meeting with <@1360639641556090894>  and <@1335299567440367757>, we‚Äôve initiated a light reorganization to continue building on the incredible work that‚Äôs already been unfolding here‚Äîthis time with stronger alignment to the broader roadmap being led by Dr. Sanchez.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt seen it yet, we invite you to check out the announcement Amber posted yesterday at 3:59 PM EST in the #announcements-community channel. It outlines the Agent Development Class, which this Non-Coders track will now seamlessly feed into‚Äîbecoming a natural and supported entry point into the larger learning journey with Gen AI Global.\n\nTo support this transition, we‚Äôre preparing a 6‚Äì8 module learning experience, modeled similarly to AGAI. You can expect live weekly sessions, hands-on assignments for each module, and the opportunity to apply what you‚Äôre learning to real-world use cases. Toward the end of the course, you‚Äôll even get to showcase your tools, ideas, and co-created solutions with your peers‚Äîhelping to shape the course collectively.\n\nIn parallel, we‚Äôll continue collecting and organizing community-generated tools, resources, and best practices for Non-Coders. These contributions will be curated into accessible repositories, making it easier for everyone to grow and learn together.\n\nAs part of this reorganization, we‚Äôll be releasing a new interest form tailored specifically for the Non-Coders group. Your input will help us personalize this experience as much as possible‚Äîso we‚Äôd love for everyone to fill it out once it goes live.\n\nTo give everyone a clearer picture of how this track interfaces with the broader program, please note the following:\n\nThe Non-Coders track exists primarily to track your learning pace through multiple data points‚Äîvideo recordings submitted to our repository, your chat interactions, and the Google Form you initially filled out to join the Agent Development Course. The goal is to use this data to place you into the most ideal cohort for the first official stage: Discord Managers. You‚Äôll be matched with others who learn at a similar pace, ensuring balanced and efficient group progress. A team of MIT alumni, working in collaboration with the SGU program and personally recommended by Dr. Sanchez, will be facilitating this data collection and execution to create the cohorts.  \n\nWhile the Non-Coders course spans 6‚Äì8 weeks with a session per week, we plan to begin onboarding you into the Discord Manager stage within just one week. That said, you can and are encouraged to continue attending the weekly Non-Coders sessions as a supplemental resource even after starting Discord Managers.\n\nThank you again for your ongoing support, enthusiasm, and commitment to this learning community. We‚Äôre incredibly excited about what‚Äôs ahead and can‚Äôt wait to build this next chapter with you.\n\nWarm regards,\nThe Non-Coders Team\nGen AI Global",

      "content": "Hi @everyone \n\nFirst of all, thank you so much for your fantastic participation and insightful comments during today‚Äôs session! Your energy and engagement made it truly special, and we are excited to keep the momentum going.\n\nAs promised, here is everything you need to continue learning at your own pace:\n\nüìÇ **Access Your Group‚Äôs Course Materials**\n‚Äì **Group 1 (Mondays):**\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zyNdLys1kQ0wHX2En79m8pIALDOIkvre?usp=sharing]\n\n‚Äì **Group 2 (Saturdays):**\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nHB8Hs8znM4FIDB8W9gUcIQnyuLI5FKo?usp=sharing]\n\nInside your folder, you‚Äôll find:\n\n**Office Hours Slides** ‚Äì easy-to-follow, friendly learning material,\n**Session Recordings** ‚Äì rewatch any class whenever you like,\n**Assignments Folder** ‚Äì this is set up with restricted edit access, so only members of your group will receive an invite via email to upload their work. Each class will have its own assignment, released progressively.,\n\nüí° **A Few Important Notes**\n\n1. These assignments are optional‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt a formal course but rather a reinforcement and extension of what you‚Äôve already learned in your AGAI program. Feel free to engage as much or as little as you like!\n\n2. We want this eight-module program to be flexible and shaped by your needs. If you have ideas for complementary topics or tools, please share them‚Äîwe‚Äôre all ears!\n\n3. The goal is to develop a personal, applied project‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs starting something new or improving an existing venture‚Äîusing the no-code AI tools we explore. This is purely for learning and community growth, not for profit. Our open-source spirit guides us all to collaborate, share, and build together.\n\nThank you again for your enthusiasm, curiosity, and commitment. We‚Äôre thrilled to have you in this community and look forward to watching everyone learn, experiment, and grow‚Äîtogether!\n\nWarmest regards,\nThe Non-Coders Team",
