I'll perform a comprehensive evaluation of the codebase, focusing on its purpose as a Discord message analysis and querying system.

1. **Core Components Analysis**:

Let me first check the main components:


Ran tool
Let me analyze each major component:

1. **Data Layer**:


Read file: db.py
2. **RAG Engine**:


Read file: rag_engine.py
3. **Time Parser**:


Read file: time_parser.py
4. **Tools and Utilities**:


Read file: tools.py
