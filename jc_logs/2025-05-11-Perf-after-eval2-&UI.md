I'll implement improvements for performance optimization, reliability, and maintainability. Let's tackle these systematically:

1. First, let's add a caching layer:



2. Now, let's add connection pooling and retry mechanisms:



3. Finally, let's add comprehensive logging and monitoring:



Now let's update the requirements.txt to include the new dependencies:



These changes implement several key improvements:

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Added caching with timeout for frequently used functions
   - Implemented connection pooling for database operations
   - Added exponential backoff for retries
   - Optimized vector search with better candidate selection

2. **Reliability**:
   - Added retry mechanisms for database operations
   - Implemented proper error handling and logging
   - Added connection pooling with automatic cleanup
   - Added transaction management with automatic rollback

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Added comprehensive logging throughout the application
   - Implemented Prometheus metrics for monitoring
   - Added performance tracking for key operations
   - Improved error messages and debugging information

Key features added:

1. **Caching System**:
   - Timeout-based caching for expensive operations
   - Configurable cache durations
   - Automatic cache invalidation

2. **Database Improvements**:
   - Connection pooling with QueuePool
   - Automatic connection recycling
   - Transaction management
   - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff

3. **Monitoring & Logging**:
   - Prometheus metrics for:
     - Query counts and errors
     - Operation durations
     - API call latencies
   - Structured logging with timestamps
   - Performance tracking
   - Error tracking and reporting

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error catching
   - Detailed error messages
   - Automatic retries for transient failures
   - Proper resource cleanup

To use these improvements:

1. Install the updated dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. The metrics server will automatically start on port 8000. You can access metrics at:
```
http://localhost:8000/metrics
```

3. Logs will be written to stdout with timestamps and proper formatting.

4. The caching system will automatically cache expensive operations like:
   - Vector store loading
   - Channel name resolution
   - Database queries

Would you like me to explain any of these improvements in more detail or make any adjustments to the implementation?



I've made significant improvements to the Streamlit interface to make it more modern and user-friendly. Here are the key changes:

1. **Enhanced Visual Design**:
   - Added a Discord logo in the header
   - Improved color scheme with a professional blue theme
   - Added subtle shadows and rounded corners
   - Better spacing and padding throughout
   - Modern typography with better font weights

2. **Improved Layout**:
   - Organized sidebar with clear sections and dividers
   - Better structured main content area
   - Cleaner message boxes with proper spacing
   - More intuitive button placement

3. **Better User Experience**:
   - Added emojis for visual cues
   - Improved button and input field styling
   - Better hover effects and transitions
   - Clearer section headers
   - More descriptive labels

4. **Enhanced Components**:
   - Better styled message boxes
   - Improved RAG context display
   - More attractive copy buttons
   - Better error and success messages
   - Nicer expandable sections

5. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Added loading animations
   - Better success/error states
   - Improved button hover states
   - Clear visual hierarchy

6. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Better contrast ratios
   - Clearer visual hierarchy
   - More consistent spacing
   - Better focus states

The interface now has a more professional and polished look while maintaining its functionality. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the design or explain any part in more detail?
