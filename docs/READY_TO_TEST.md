```
"What are the most frequently asked questions about prompt engineering?"
"Compile all questions about AI model training"
"Extract questions and solutions about AI implementation challenges"
```

### **Server Data Analysis** (Likely to return real data)
```
"Analyze message activity patterns across all buddy groups"
"Show me conversation threads with most responses in general-chat"
"Identify users most active in sharing resources"
```
