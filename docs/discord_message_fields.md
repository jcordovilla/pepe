## Database Schema Updates

The database has been migrated to include all new fields with proper indexing and data types:

- **JSON fields** for complex data (embeds, attachments, components, etc.)
- **Boolean fields** for flags (tts, pinned)
- **DateTime fields** for timestamps (edited_at)
- **String fields** for IDs and types
- **Text fields** for content variations (clean_content, system_content)

## Search and Analysis Benefits

These enhanced fields enable:

1. **Rich Content Discovery** - Find messages with specific media types, embeds, or attachments
2. **Conversation Threading** - Track reply chains and thread relationships
3. **Bot/System Message Analysis** - Identify and analyze automated content
4. **Edit History Tracking** - Find recently edited messages
5. **Reaction Analysis** - Enhanced emoji and reaction patterns
6. **Poll Data Mining** - Analyze community polls and voting patterns
7. **Link Preview Analysis** - Rich embed content for better search relevance
8. **File Sharing Patterns** - Track document and media sharing behaviors

## Migration Notes

- All existing messages retain their original fields
- New fields are nullable and backward-compatible
- The migration adds columns without data loss
- Future message fetches will populate all new fields
- Search tools automatically handle both old and new field formats

## Performance Considerations

- JSON fields are efficiently stored and indexed
- Complex queries can filter by message type, flags, or content types
- Attachment metadata enables media-specific searches
- Thread relationships support conversation analysis

## API Compatibility

The enhanced system maintains full backward compatibility while providing access to all Discord API message capabilities. Tools and searches will automatically benefit from the additional metadata without requiring code changes.
