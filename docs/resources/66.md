description: This arXiv paper presents a detailed comparative analysis of Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation (RAG) safety, exploring how RAG models can produce unsafe outputs even
  when provided with safe documents. It offers valuable insights for researchers and
  practitioners interested in the safety and reliability of AI language models.
