Periodic table of machine learning‚Äù could fuel AI discovery
Researchers have created a unifying framework that can help scientists combine existing ideas to improve AI models or create new ones.

MIT researchers have created a periodic table that shows how more than 20 classical machine-learning algorithms are connected. The new framework sheds light on how scientists could fuse strategies from different methods to improve existing AI models or come up with new ones.
