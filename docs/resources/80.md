Dear community, 
for my **Tuesday tech tip** I found the following post to be useful regarding improving my prompt engineering: Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques for 2025: Beyond Basic.

**Tip Summary: **This post introduces advanced prompt engineering strategies such as “Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting”, “Context-Aware Decomposition”, “Controlled Hallucination", and "Multi-Perspective Simulation." 
For **highly creative brainstorming** and out-of-the-box thinking (which I regularly do
