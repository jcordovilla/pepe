      "date": "2025-10-01",
      "description": "Developing effective prompts demands significant cognitive investment to\ngenerate reliable, high-quality responses from Large Language Models (LLMs). By\ndeploying case-specific prompt engineering techniques that streamline\nfrequently performed life sciences workflows, researchers could achieve\nsubstantial efficiency gains that far exceed the initial time investment\nrequired to master these techniques. The Prompt Report published in 2025\noutlined 58 different text-based prompt engineering techniques, highlighting\nthe numerous ways prompts could be constructed. To provide actionable\nguidelines and reduce the friction of navigating these various approaches, we\ndistil this report to focus on 6 core techniques: zero-shot, few-shot\napproaches, thought generation, ensembling, self-criticism, and decomposition.\nWe breakdown the significance of each approach and ground it in use cases\nrelevant to life sciences, from literature summarization and data extraction to\neditorial tasks. We provide detailed recommendations for how prompts should and\nshouldn't be structured, addressing common pitfalls including multi-turn\nconversation degradation, hallucinations, and distinctions between reasoning\nand non-reasoning models. We examine context window limitations, agentic tools\nlike Claude Code, while analyzing the effectiveness of Deep Research tools\nacross OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Perplexity platforms, discussing current\nlimitations. We demonstrate how prompt engineering can augment rather than\nreplace existing established individual practices around data processing and\ndocument editing. Our aim is to provide actionable guidance on core prompt\nengineering principles, and to facilitate the transition from opportunistic\nprompting to an effective, low-friction systematic practice that contributes to\nhigher quality research."

      "description": "This paper describes the participation of HULAT-UC3M in CLEARS 2025 Subtask\n1: Adaptation of Text to Plain Language (PL) in Spanish. We explored strategies\nbased on models trained on Spanish texts, including a zero-shot configuration\nusing prompt engineering and a fine-tuned version with Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA). Different strategies were evaluated on representative internal subsets\nof the training data, using the official task metrics, cosine similarity (SIM)\nand the Fern\\'andez-Huerta readability index (FH) to guide the selection of the\noptimal model and prompt combination. The final system was selected for its\nbalanced and consistent performance, combining normalization steps, the\nRigoChat-7B-v2 model, and a dedicated PL-oriented prompt. It ranked first in\nsemantic similarity (SIM = 0.75), however, fourth in readability (FH = 69.72).\nWe also discuss key challenges related to training data heterogeneity and the\nlimitations of current evaluation metrics in capturing both linguistic clarity\nand content preservation."

      "description": "This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted\nessay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine,\nand Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same\ncondition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group\n(LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition\n(Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18\ncompleting session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive\nload during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring\nessays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs,\nn-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG\nrevealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants\nexhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed\nmoderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity.\nCognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4,\nLLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity,\nindicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall\nand activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search\nEngine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group\nand the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately\nquote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings\nhighlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently\nunderperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results\nraise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and\nunderscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning."

      "tag": "Research Papers",
      "date": "2025-05-27",
      "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various\napplications. The functionalities of recent LLMs can be flexibly modulated via\nnatural language prompts. This renders them susceptible to targeted adversarial\nprompting, e.g., Prompt Injection (PI) attacks enable attackers to override\noriginal instructions and employed controls. So far, it was assumed that the\nuser is directly prompting the LLM. But, what if it is not the user prompting?\nWe argue that LLM-Integrated Applications blur the line between data and\ninstructions. We reveal new attack vectors, using Indirect Prompt Injection,\nthat enable adversaries to remotely (without a direct interface) exploit\nLLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likely\nto be retrieved. We derive a comprehensive taxonomy from a computer security\nperspective to systematically investigate impacts and vulnerabilities,\nincluding data theft, worming, information ecosystem contamination, and other\nnovel security risks. We demonstrate our attacks' practical viability against\nboth real-world systems, such as Bing's GPT-4 powered Chat and code-completion\nengines, and synthetic applications built on GPT-4. We show how processing\nretrieved prompts can act as arbitrary code execution, manipulate the\napplication's functionality, and control how and if other APIs are called.\nDespite the increasing integration and reliance on LLMs, effective mitigations\nof these emerging threats are currently lacking. By raising awareness of these\nvulnerabilities and providing key insights into their implications, we aim to\npromote the safe and responsible deployment of these powerful models and the\ndevelopment of robust defenses that protect users and systems from potential\nattacks."

      "date": "2025-05-21",
      "description": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in\nenhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning\ndirectly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the\nzero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still\ndepend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training.\nThe scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the\nlong-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already\nevident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a\nhypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by\nhumans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To\naddress these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in\nwhich a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning\nprogress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any\nexternal data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner\n(AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability\nby using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and\nverify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide\nopen-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without\nexternal data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical\nreasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens\nof thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is\ncompatible with various model classes."

      "tag": "Research Papers",
      "date": "2025-05-13",
      "description": "Today's gen-AI workflows that involve multiple ML model calls, tool/API\ncalls, data retrieval, or generic code execution are often tuned manually in an\nad-hoc way that is both time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we\npropose a systematic approach for automatically tuning gen-AI workflows. Our\nkey insight is that gen-AI workflows can benefit from structure, operator, and\nprompt changes, but unique properties of gen-AI workflows require new\noptimization techniques. We propose AdaSeek, an adaptive hierarchical search\nalgorithm for autotuning gen-AI workflows. AdaSeek organizes workflow tuning\nmethods into different layers based on the user-specified total search budget\nand distributes the budget across different layers based on the complexity of\neach layer. During its hierarchical search, AdaSeek redistributes the search\nbudget from less useful to more promising tuning configurations based on\nworkflow-level evaluation results. We implement AdaSeek in a workflow\nautotuning framework called Cognify and evaluate Cognify using six types of\nworkflows such as RAG-based QA and text-to-SQL transformation. Overall, Cognify\nimproves these workflows' generation quality by up to 2.8x, reduces execution\nmonetary cost by up to 10x, and reduces end-to-end latency by 2.7x."

      "description": "Background: The HERMES Kiosk (Healthcare Enhanced Recommendations through\nArtificial Intelligence & Expertise System) is designed to provide personalized\nOver-the-Counter (OTC) medication recommendations, addressing the limitations\nof traditional health kiosks. It integrates an advanced GAMENet model enhanced\nwith Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Multi-Head Cross-Attention (MHCA) while\nensuring user privacy through federated learning. This paper outlines the\nconceptual design and architecture of HERMES, with a focus on deployment in\nhigh-traffic public areas. Methods: HERMES analyzes self-reported symptoms and\nanonymized medical histories using AI algorithms to generate context-aware OTC\nmedication recommendations. The system was initially trained using Electronic\nHealth Records (EHR) from the MIMIC-III dataset (6,350 patients) and Drug-Drug\nInteraction (DDI) data from the TWOSIDES database, incorporating the top 90\nseverity DDI types. Real-time DDI checks and ATC-mapped drug codes further\nimprove safety. The kiosk is designed for accessibility, offering multilingual\nsupport, large fonts, voice commands, and Braille compatibility. A built-in\nhealth education library promotes preventive care and health literacy. A survey\nwas conducted among 10 medical professionals to evaluate its potential\napplications in medicine. Results: Preliminary results show that the enhanced\nGAMENet model achieved a Precision-Recall AUC (PRAUC) of 0.74, outperforming\nthe original model. These findings suggest a strong potential for delivering\naccurate and secure healthcare recommendations in public settings. Conclusion:\nHERMES demonstrates how AI-driven, privacy-preserving kiosks can enhance public\nhealth access, empower users, and alleviate burdens on healthcare systems.\nFuture work will focus on real-world deployment, usability testing, and\nscalability for broader adoption."

We explore the causes of this change and find\nthat even combinations of safe models with safe documents can cause unsafe\ngenerations. In addition, we evaluate some existing red teaming methods for RAG\nsettings and show that they are less effective than when used for non-RAG\nsettings.

      "description": "Responsible prompt engineering has emerged as a critical framework for\nensuring that generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems serve society's\nneeds while minimizing potential harms. As generative AI applications become\nincreasingly powerful and ubiquitous, the way we instruct and interact with\nthem through prompts has profound implications for fairness, accountability,\nand transparency. This article examines how strategic prompt engineering can\nembed ethical and legal considerations and societal values directly into AI\ninteractions, moving beyond mere technical optimization for functionality. This\narticle proposes a comprehensive framework for responsible prompt engineering\nthat encompasses five interconnected components: prompt design, system\nselection, system configuration, performance evaluation, and prompt management.\nDrawing from empirical evidence, the paper demonstrates how each component can\nbe leveraged to promote improved societal outcomes while mitigating potential\nrisks. The analysis reveals that effective prompt engineering requires a\ndelicate balance between technical precision and ethical consciousness,\ncombining the systematic rigor and focus on functionality with the nuanced\nunderstanding of social impact. Through examination of real-world and emerging\npractices, the article illustrates how responsible prompt engineering serves as\na crucial bridge between AI development and deployment, enabling organizations\nto fine-tune AI outputs without modifying underlying model architectures. This\napproach aligns with broader \"Responsibility by Design\" principles, embedding\nethical considerations directly into the implementation process rather than\ntreating them as post-hoc additions. The article concludes by identifying key\nresearch directions and practical guidelines for advancing the field of\nresponsible prompt engineering."

      "description": "Tactile graphics are essential for providing access to visual information for\nthe 43 million people globally living with vision loss. Traditional methods for\ncreating these graphics are labor-intensive and cannot meet growing demand. We\nintroduce TactileNet, the first comprehensive dataset and AI-driven framework\nfor generating embossing-ready 2D tactile templates using text-to-image Stable\nDiffusion (SD) models. By integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and\nDreamBooth, our method fine-tunes SD models to produce high-fidelity,\nguideline-compliant graphics while reducing computational costs. Quantitative\nevaluations with tactile experts show 92.86% adherence to accessibility\nstandards. Structural fidelity analysis revealed near-human design similarity,\nwith an SSIM of 0.538 between generated graphics and expert-designed tactile\nimages. Notably, our method preserves object silhouettes better than human\ndesigns (SSIM = 0.259 vs. 0.215 for binary masks), addressing a key limitation\nof manual tactile abstraction. The framework scales to 32,000 images (7,050\nhigh-quality) across 66 classes, with prompt editing enabling customizable\noutputs (e.g., adding or removing details). By automating the 2D template\ngeneration step-compatible with standard embossing workflows-TactileNet\naccelerates production while preserving design flexibility.
