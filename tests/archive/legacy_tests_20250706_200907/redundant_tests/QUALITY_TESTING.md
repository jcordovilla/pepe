# Comprehensive Agent Quality Testing System

This advanced testing system provides comprehensive evaluation of our agentic architecture across multiple dimensions, delivering both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights with actionable recommendations for improvement.

## Overview

The testing system measures agent behavior across three key areas:

### ðŸ”¢ Quantitative Metrics
- **Performance Scores**: Accuracy, relevance, completeness, clarity, usefulness (0-10 scale)
- **Response Times**: Average, median, P95, maximum response times
- **Success Rates**: Query completion rates by category and complexity
- **System Metrics**: API calls, cache hit rates, memory usage
- **Quality Distribution**: Distribution across quality levels (Excellent, Good, Acceptable, Poor, Failing)

### ðŸŽ¯ Qualitative Analysis
- **Strengths & Weaknesses**: Detailed analysis of response quality
- **User Experience Assessment**: UX impact and usability evaluation
- **Technical Precision**: Accuracy of technical information and responses
- **Context Understanding**: How well the system grasps user intent
- **Error Handling Quality**: Graceful degradation and error recovery

### ðŸ“ˆ Performance Insights

- **Actionable Recommendations**: Specific technical and UX improvements

## Test Architecture

### Test Scenarios

The system evaluates 10 comprehensive scenarios covering:

1. **Simple Queries** - Basic keyword searches
2. **Temporal Queries** - Time-based filtering and analysis
3. **Digest Generation** - Weekly/monthly summaries with engagement analysis
4. **Complex Analysis** - Multi-step reasoning and pattern analysis
5. **Multi-Intent Queries** - Queries requiring multiple agent coordination
6. **Error Handling** - Invalid inputs and graceful degradation
7. **Ambiguous Queries** - Intent clarification and context understanding
8. **User-Specific Queries** - Personalized information retrieval
9. **Performance Analysis** - Metrics and trend analysis
10. **Channel Analysis** - Channel-specific pattern recognition

### Complexity Levels

Each query is classified by complexity:
- **Simple**: Basic keyword matching
