## üöÄ Core Scripts

### **`pepe-admin`**
Unified admin CLI tool for system management.
```bash
# Always use Poetry for admin commands
poetry run ./pepe-admin --help
```

## üîß Data Management Scripts

### **`discord_message_fetcher.py`**
Fetch messages from Discord and store them in SQLite database.
```bash
# Full fetch (all messages)
poetry run python scripts/discord_message_fetcher.py --full

# Incremental fetch (new messages only)
poetry run python scripts/discord_message_fetcher.py --incremental
```

### **`index_database_messages.py`**
Index messages from SQLite database into vector store for semantic search.
```bash
# Full indexing (all messages)
poetry run python scripts/index_database_messages.py --full

# Incremental indexing (new messages only)
poetry run python scripts/index_database_messages.py --incremental
```

### **`resource_detector.py`**
CLI-based resource detection using local Llama models.
```bash
# Detect resources from messages
poetry run python scripts/resource_detector.py

# Use fast model for quicker processing
poetry run python scripts/resource_detector.py --fast-model

# Reset cache and reprocess all resources
poetry run python scripts/resource_detector.py --reset-cache
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance Scripts

### **`delete_and_recreate_collection.py`**
Delete and recreate database collection (useful for fixing database issues).
```bash
poetry run python scripts/delete_and_recreate_collection.py
```

## üéØ Quick Usage Guide

### First Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Ensure Poetry environment is active
poetry shell

# 2. Setup system
poetry run ./pepe-admin setup

# 3. Fetch Discord messages
poetry run ./pepe-admin sync --full

# 4. Start bot
poetry run python main.py
```

### Regular Maintenance
```bash
# Check system status
poetry run ./pepe-admin info

# Incremental sync (new messages only)
poetry run ./pepe-admin sync

# Run system validation
poetry run ./pepe-admin test

# Detect resources
poetry run ./pepe-admin resources detect
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Always use Poetry**: All commands should be run with `poetry run` or within `poetry shell`
- **Real-time processing** - Messages are handled as they arrive
- **Unified architecture** - All functionality integrated into main bot
- **Local Llama models** - Resource detection uses local models for privacy
- **MCP SQLite integration** - Database operations use standardized MCP protocol

## Running Scripts

All scripts should be run from the project root directory using Poetry:

```bash
# From project root
cd /Users/jose/Documents/apps/discord-bot-agentic

# Option 1: Use poetry run for each command
poetry run ./pepe-admin info
poetry run ./pepe-admin sync
poetry run python scripts/discord_message_fetcher.py --incremental

# Option 2: Activate Poetry shell and run commands directly
poetry shell
./pepe-admin info
./pepe-admin sync
python scripts/discord_message_fetcher.py --incremental
```

## Poetry Environment Management

### **Activating the Poetry Environment**
```bash
# Activate Poetry virtual environment
poetry shell

# Verify you're in the Poetry environment
which python
# Should show: /Users/jose/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/pepe-discord-bot-5qtDQwBU-py3.11/bin/python
```

### **Installing Dependencies**
```bash
# Install all dependencies
poetry install

# Add new dependency
poetry add package-name

# Add development dependency
poetry add --group dev package-name
```

### **Running Tests**
```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_discord_bot_core.py

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=agentic
```

### **Code Formatting**
```bash
# Format code with black
poetry run black .

# Sort imports
poetry run isort .

# Type checking
poetry run mypy agentic/
```

## Integration with Main System

These scripts work with the agentic framework and will:
- Automatically create necessary data directories
- Use the same configuration as the main application
- Provide detailed logging and error reporting
- Maintain compatibility with the production environment
- Always use the Poetry-managed dependencies
